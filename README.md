Fake news - Presentation Group 1.pptx has the presentation where you can find a glimpse of all the activities done in the project and the thought process
main_bare_minimum1.ipynb and main_bare_minimum2.ipynb are notebooks we used to deliver the bare minimum
main_4models_n_BERT(pulk17).ipynb is the notebook where you can find the classic machine learning, was run on laptop local GPU. Split the data.csv for training and test. Cross validation used for the non-BERT models.
main (Project_3_BERT).ipynb is notebook which contains the final model we used. No training needed. Only testing with the whole set of data.csv.
bert_validation_predictions.csv has the predictions of our chosen model, BERT. 
predicted_validation_data_from_XGBoost.csv has the predictions of the classic machine learning best model, XGBoost. 
data.csv is the training and test data(when split is necessary)
validation_data.csv is the base data in which we predicted labels.
