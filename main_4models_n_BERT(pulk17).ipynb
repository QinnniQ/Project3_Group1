         "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - South Pacific island nations are scouring shipping records for vessels with links to North Korea after Fiji said it had identified 20 falsely flagged ships it suspects the isolated regime is using to evade United Nations sanctions. Fiji, along with Interpol and the Singapore-based regional shipping regulator Tokyo MoU, are investigating the vessels for links to North Korea, a spokesman for the country s Maritime Safety Authority (MSAF) told Reuters on Friday. Interpol and Tokyo MoU did not immediately respond to requests for comment on their investigations. The 18 members of the Pacific Islands Forum this month agreed to launch an audit of every ship registered in the Pacific to search for any links to North Korea. New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Gerry Brownlee said Pacific countries, including his own, were concerned North Korea was using falsely flagged cargo ships as one avenue to trade goods in spite of sanctions.  What we do know is that declared North Korean GDP (gross domestic product) is not big enough to support the nuclear program that they re running so there has to be significant black market or offbook revenue going into the country,  Brownlee told Reuters in a phone interview this week. The move came as the UN on Monday ramped up sanctions on North Korea, including tightening up oversight of vessels on the high seas. Authorities will now be allowed to check suspected vessels for prohibited cargo with the authority of the flag country.  UN sanctions introduced in August banned North Korean exports of seafood as part of efforts to curtail the regime s access to foreign funds. North Korea had been expected to earn an estimated $295 million from seafood in 2017, one U.N. diplomat said. In Fiji s case, the North Korean-linked ships had adopted the island nation s flag without formally registering, the MSAF said. It was not known in what way the possibly more-than 20 vessels were linked to North Korea or what their suspected activities or locations were. The MSAF declined to provide details due to the ongoing investigation. In addition to the fraudulent use of flags, Pacific governments were concerned North Korean vessels could be quietly registering in nations that allow international ships to use their flags.     If it s not clear why they re on that register, in other words, they re not regular callers into Pacific ports, then further investigation is needed to untangle the ship owner,  said Brownlee. The review would take place over the next couple of months, Brownlee said, and Australia and New Zealand would provide intelligence to help the small island nations check any North Korean connections.

         "ADEN, Yemen (Reuters) - Three suspected al Qaeda militants were killed in a drone strike in southern Yemen late on Thursday, a local security official and residents said. The strike in Mudiyah district in Abyan province on the Arabian Sea coast had targeted a motorcycle which the suspected militants were riding, the official said. Abyan is one of several provinces in central and southern Yemen where Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and its local affiliate Ansar al-Sharia operate. AQAP has taken advantage of a more than two-year civil war between the Iran-aligned Houthi group and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi s Saudi-backed government to strengthen its position in the impoverished country. The United States has repeatedly attacked AQAP with aircraft and unmanned drones in what U.S. officials say is a campaign to wear down the group s ability to coordinate attacks abroad. The Saudi-led coalition supporting Hadi has also launched thousands of air strikes against the Houthis which control Yemen s capital and much of the country s north. The Houthis have in turn fired rockets towards Saudi cities and villages. They say their attacks are in response to Saudi strikes on Yemeni cities and villages. The coalition spokesman said on Thursday that a Saudi pilot had died a day earlier when his plane crashed in the southern province of Abyan due to  technical failure , the Saudi news agency SPA said. The war has killed more than 10,000 people. ",

         "Chinese academics prod Beijing to consider North Korea contingencies",
         "BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese academics are publicly broaching the idea that China and the United States should share plans on how to deal with a  potential conflict on the Korean Peninsula, a sign some say of how North Korea s weapons test may be making Beijing more open to the once taboo subject. Chinese officials have rebuffed top U.S. military brass for years in their efforts to share contingencies for war or regime collapse in Pyongyang, suspicious over Washington s intentions and fearful that such engagement could further alienate North Korea, their once steadfast wartime ally. Jia Qingguo, the dean of the School of International Studies at China s elite Peking University and a respected advisor to Chinese leaders, said in an article this week that with the chances of war increasing daily, it might be time for China to  prepare for the worst .  When war becomes a real possibility, China must be prepared. And, with this in mind, China must be more willing to consider talks with concerned countries on contingency plans,  Jia wrote in an article first published on the online East Asia Forum run out of Australian National University. Given recent developments,  Beijing may have no better choice than to start talking with Washington and Seoul , Jia said. Ties between China and North Korea have deteriorated sharply in recent years, to the point some diplomats and experts fear Beijing may become, like Washington, a target of its neighbor s ire. Jia s comments, at the forefront of what is still a sensitive debate in China, were made before North Korea on Friday fired a missile that flew over Japan s northern Hokkaido far out into the Pacific Ocean.  That test came after the U.N. Security Council s latest round of sanctions on Monday banning North Korea s textile exports and capping fuel supplies in response to Pyongyang s accelerated effort to target the United States with a powerful, nuclear-tipped missile. Xie Tao, associate dean at the School of English and International Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said Chinese academics in years past would typically only express their opinions on whether China should be sharing plans with Washington behind closed doors.  Now you can get all sorts of people from the left and right and they are allowed to make their views public,  Xie told Reuters.  You could interpret that as a signal that the Chinese government is perhaps willing now to consider, if not actually join up to, contingency plans,  Xie said.  My sense is that there must be some in-depth discussion about what could potentially happen if there is a collapse or internal chaos   how Beijing and Washington should respond to this.  During a trip to China in August, Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended Chinese military drills at China s Northern Theater Command in the city of Shenyang, which covers China s border with North Korea.  Some analysts perceived that as China opening a crack in the door to its own preparations, but neither side are showing their cards to the public. Dunford said in Beijing during that visit that despite Washington s urgings the  conditions aren t set for such a detailed conversation  between the two militaries.  U.S. military officials have privately voiced frustration that previous channels established for direct military communications line are essentially unstaffed on the Chinese side. Dunford said creating a round-the-clock  responsive  communications link that could be used in a crisis was a top priority for military ties.

         "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - South Pacific island nations are scouring shipping records for vessels with links to North Korea after Fiji said it had identified 20 falsely flagged ships it suspects the isolated regime is using to evade United Nations sanctions. Fiji, along with Interpol and the Singapore-based regional shipping regulator Tokyo MoU, are investigating the vessels for links to North Korea, a spokesman for the country s Maritime Safety Authority (MSAF) told Reuters on Friday. Interpol and Tokyo MoU did not immediately respond to requests for comment on their investigations. The 18 members of the Pacific Islands Forum this month agreed to launch an audit of every ship registered in the Pacific to search for any links to North Korea. New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Gerry Brownlee said Pacific countries, including his own, were concerned North Korea was using falsely flagged cargo ships as one avenue to trade goods in spite of sanctions.  What we do know is that declared North Korean GDP (gross domestic product) is not big enough to support the nuclear program that they re running so there has to be significant black market or offbook revenue going into the country,  Brownlee told Reuters in a phone interview this week. The move came as the UN on Monday ramped up sanctions on North Korea, including tightening up oversight of vessels on the high seas. Authorities will now be allowed to check suspected vessels for prohibited cargo with the authority of the flag country.  UN sanctions introduced in August banned North Korean exports of seafood as part of efforts to curtail the regime s access to foreign funds. North Korea had been expected to earn an estimated $295 million from seafood in 2017, one U.N. diplomat said. In Fiji s case, the North Korean-linked ships had adopted the island nation s flag without formally registering, the MSAF said. It was not known in what way the possibly more-than 20 vessels were linked to North Korea or what their suspected activities or locations were. The MSAF declined to provide details due to the ongoing investigation. In addition to the fraudulent use of flags, Pacific governments were concerned North Korean vessels could be quietly registering in nations that allow international ships to use their flags.     If it s not clear why they re on that register, in other words, they re not regular callers into Pacific ports, then further investigation is needed to untangle the ship owner,  said Brownlee. The review would take place over the next couple of months, Brownlee said, and Australia and New Zealand would provide intelligence to help the small island nations check any North Korean connections.

         "ADEN, Yemen (Reuters) - Three suspected al Qaeda militants were killed in a drone strike in southern Yemen late on Thursday, a local security official and residents said. The strike in Mudiyah district in Abyan province on the Arabian Sea coast had targeted a motorcycle which the suspected militants were riding, the official said. Abyan is one of several provinces in central and southern Yemen where Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and its local affiliate Ansar al-Sharia operate. AQAP has taken advantage of a more than two-year civil war between the Iran-aligned Houthi group and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi s Saudi-backed government to strengthen its position in the impoverished country. The United States has repeatedly attacked AQAP with aircraft and unmanned drones in what U.S. officials say is a campaign to wear down the group s ability to coordinate attacks abroad. The Saudi-led coalition supporting Hadi has also launched thousands of air strikes against the Houthis which control Yemen s capital and much of the country s north. The Houthis have in turn fired rockets towards Saudi cities and villages. They say their attacks are in response to Saudi strikes on Yemeni cities and villages. The coalition spokesman said on Thursday that a Saudi pilot had died a day earlier when his plane crashed in the southern province of Abyan due to  technical failure , the Saudi news agency SPA said. The war has killed more than 10,000 people. ",

         "Chinese academics prod Beijing to consider North Korea contingencies",
         "BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese academics are publicly broaching the idea that China and the United States should share plans on how to deal with a  potential conflict on the Korean Peninsula, a sign some say of how North Korea s weapons test may be making Beijing more open to the once taboo subject. Chinese officials have rebuffed top U.S. military brass for years in their efforts to share contingencies for war or regime collapse in Pyongyang, suspicious over Washington s intentions and fearful that such engagement could further alienate North Korea, their once steadfast wartime ally. Jia Qingguo, the dean of the School of International Studies at China s elite Peking University and a respected advisor to Chinese leaders, said in an article this week that with the chances of war increasing daily, it might be time for China to  prepare for the worst .  When war becomes a real possibility, China must be prepared. And, with this in mind, China must be more willing to consider talks with concerned countries on contingency plans,  Jia wrote in an article first published on the online East Asia Forum run out of Australian National University. Given recent developments,  Beijing may have no better choice than to start talking with Washington and Seoul , Jia said. Ties between China and North Korea have deteriorated sharply in recent years, to the point some diplomats and experts fear Beijing may become, like Washington, a target of its neighbor s ire. Jia s comments, at the forefront of what is still a sensitive debate in China, were made before North Korea on Friday fired a missile that flew over Japan s northern Hokkaido far out into the Pacific Ocean.  That test came after the U.N. Security Council s latest round of sanctions on Monday banning North Korea s textile exports and capping fuel supplies in response to Pyongyang s accelerated effort to target the United States with a powerful, nuclear-tipped missile. Xie Tao, associate dean at the School of English and International Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said Chinese academics in years past would typically only express their opinions on whether China should be sharing plans with Washington behind closed doors.  Now you can get all sorts of people from the left and right and they are allowed to make their views public,  Xie told Reuters.  You could interpret that as a signal that the Chinese government is perhaps willing now to consider, if not actually join up to, contingency plans,  Xie said.  My sense is that there must be some in-depth discussion about what could potentially happen if there is a collapse or internal chaos   how Beijing and Washington should respond to this.  During a trip to China in August, Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended Chinese military drills at China s Northern Theater Command in the city of Shenyang, which covers China s border with North Korea.  Some analysts perceived that as China opening a crack in the door to its own preparations, but neither side are showing their cards to the public. Dunford said in Beijing during that visit that despite Washington s urgings the  conditions aren t set for such a detailed conversation  between the two militaries.  U.S. military officials have privately voiced frustration that previous channels established for direct military communications line are essentially unstaffed on the Chinese side. Dunford said creating a round-the-clock  responsive  communications link that could be used in a crisis was a top priority for military ties.

         "Peru's Congress ousts cabinet as political crisis deepens",
         "LIMA (Reuters) - Peru s opposition-controlled Congress ousted center-right President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski s cabinet in a vote of no-confidence early on Friday, pitching the copper-producing Andean country into its worst political crisis in years. In a gamble that will likely force him to scrap his plans to travel abroad later in the day, Kuczynski had dared Congress on Wednesday to revoke its confidence in his cabinet if it insisted on forcing out his second education minister. Under Peru s constitution, if Congress does not deliver a president a vote of confidence for his cabinets twice, the president can summon new legislative elections. But the rightwing populist opposition party Popular Force, led by Kuczynski s defeated electoral rival, Keiko Fujimori, answered Prime Minister Fernando Zavala s request on Thursday to back his cabinet with a resounding  no.  Peru s single-chamber Congress, where Popular Force has an absolute majority, voted 77-22 to dismiss Zavala s cabinet. Kuczynski now has 72 hours to swear in a new cabinet. While he cannot name Zavala as prime minister again, Kuczynski can reappoint other ministers in his cabinet. Going forward, Kuczynski might have a freer hand to govern in the remaining four years of his term if the opposition steers clear of a fresh confrontation out of fear of losing its majority. But several opposition lawmakers said they would welcome taking the battle to the ballot box.  If they close Congress, we re not afraid,  said Hector Becerril, a hard-line Popular Force lawmaker.  We re willing to seek the people s support again. And it won t be 13 seats we win, or 73. There ll be 100 of us!  The vote came on the eve of Kuczynski s 8-day trip abroad, which includes plans for dinner with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, a speech before the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday and a meeting with Pope Francis in the Vatican. Kuczynski, a 78-year-old former Wall Street banker who has vowed to modernize Peru and revive economic growth, took office a year ago with one of the weakest mandates of any president, having beat Fujimori by a razor-thin margin while his party only secured a small portion of seats in Congress. In a plenary debate that stretched on for more than seven hours, opposition lawmakers portrayed Kuczynski as an out-of-touch lobbyist who lacks authority and poses a danger to Peru. Congress has forced Kuczynski s former education and finance ministers to resign amid allegations of ethical breaches, while a third minister quit to avoid being censured. Popular Force announced this week that it planned to propose censuring Education Minister Marilu Martens over her handling of a teachers  2-month strike, which her supporters alleged was fueled by an alliance between Popular Force and extremists.  We can t deliver the head of a minister as a trophy,  Zavala told lawmakers after walking to Congress with the rest of the cabinet in a show of union.  It s clear to us that the country can t make progress like this.  ",

         "TAIPEI (Reuters) - A Taiwan court on Friday jailed a mainland Chinese man for 14 months for breaching national security laws, following months of strained relations over China s detention of a national from the self-ruled island. China, which sees Taiwan as a wayward province to be taken back by force, if necessary, severed official communications last year to pressure President Tsai Ing-wen, whose party traditionally favors independence, to concede its position.  Zhou Hongxu, formerly a student in Taiwan, was charged for seeking to arrange meetings between a Taiwan government official and a Chinese Communist party official outside Taiwan, in return for payment to the Taiwan official, a court document showed. Zhou  intentionally  jeopardized national security, though the attempt was unsuccessful, the court said in the document released after the verdict.    Zhou, who had met the Chinese official at a 2014 event in  Shanghai in 2014, did not plead guilty, his lawyer said, despite a confession during the trial that he later described as having  been made in improper circumstances.  He appeared in court on Friday in a calm mood and dressed in dark colors.  The court reduced his sentence, taking into account his confession, and the failure of the bid to breach national security, it said in its statement. On Monday, a Taiwanese activist, Li Ming-che, confessed in a Chinese court to attempting to subvert the Beijing government,  videos of his hearing released by Chinese authorities showed, although his wife refused to recognize the court s authority. Li, a community college teacher known for his pro-democracy and rights activism, had gone missing on a trip to mainland China in March. ",

         "Philippines orders retraining, reassignment of 1,200 police after alleged abuses",
         "MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine capital s police chief ordered that the entire 1,200-member police force in one of Manila s biggest areas be relieved of duty and retrained on Friday in response to a series of controversies, including the killing of two teenagers. Metro Manila s top officer Oscar Albayalde said all police personnel in the Caloocan area of the capital would undergo retraining and reorientation before being reassigned to other police units, not necessarily in Manila.  We will start with the city s police precincts 2 and 7,  Albayalde said. All personnel in Caloocan s headquarters and seven precincts would be temporarily replaced by the regional public safety battalion, a combat-trained unit.  This will be done in batches,  he said. Albayalde did not say how long the retraining would last and how long it would take for the entire police force in Caloocan to be replaced. It is the first time an entire city police unit has been relieved of its duties since President Rodrigo Duterte unleashed his bloody crackdown against illegal drugs 15 months ago, a campaign that has killed thousands of Filipinos. The move comes amid intense scrutiny of police activities in Caloocan in the wake of the killing of 17-year old Kian Loyd Delos Santos last month in what police said was an anti-drugs operation. His lawyers and family say he was murdered in cold blood. Three officers involved in his killing say he fired at them and they acted in self-defense. Duterte, known for his frequent speeches that call for drug dealers to be killed, ordered a thorough investigation into the Delos Santos killing and warned police he would not tolerate abuses. Another teenager, Carl Arnaiz, suffered a similar fate, accused of trying to rob a taxi driver and shooting at police who tried to arrest him. The taxi driver told reporters on Sunday he saw him alive in custody. About two dozen Caloocan residents, holding placards saying  Stop the Killings , held a noisy protest outside the precinct s police headquarters. Dozens of police trainees stood in front and watched the protest. Friday s order came only a day after Philippine media reported members of the Caloocan precinct 4 raided an elderly woman s home and reportedly stole money in an incident captured on closed circuit television cameras. Reuters could not confirm the report independently. Activists accuse police of executing suspected users and dealers systematically during anti-drugs operations and say official reports that say victims violently resisted arrest are implausible, and contrary to witness accounts. Police reject those allegations and Duterte has been furious at critics and political opponents who say he has a  kill policy . The video of the alleged robbery was uploaded on social media sites and went viral, which angered senior police generals. Albayalde immediately issued the orders to relieve the Caloocan precincts.  From what we have seen this has been done or will continue to be done by others so it is best to implement this preemptive measure to avoid similar incidents,  Albayalde told reporters. He warned other districts in Manila could face similar sanctions if they did not shape up. ",

         "Cambodia PM calls on U.S. to withdraw Peace Corps volunteers",
         "PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen called on the United States on Friday to withdraw Peace Corps volunteers in an escalating row over accusations that U.S. agents conspired with an opposition leader to plot treason. Hun Sen was responding after the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh issued a travel warning that urged citizens to show caution amid  anti-American rhetoric by officials .  Are you scaring Cambodians?  Hun Sen said of the United States in an address to garment workers at factories which export much of their production to the United States.  Are you prepared to invade Cambodia and that s why you told Americans to be careful? It s good if you pull out the Peace Corps,  Hun Sen said. The U.S. embassy declined to comment. It has previously dismissed the accusations of collusion with opposition leader Kem Sokha and called for his release. On Friday, the embassy was swearing in 71 new volunteers from the Peace Corps, which sends Americans abroad to help with local projects with the stated goal of promoting mutual understanding. Hun Sen said on Friday that he had ordered an investigation into whether any Americans were involved with Kem Sokha. Opponents of Hun Sen accuse him of arresting Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha and cracking down on independent media and other critics ahead of a general election next year. The evidence presented against Kem Sokha is a video recorded in 2013 in which he discusses a strategy to win power with the help of unspecified Americans. Hun Sen, a close ally of China, has taken a series of measures against U.S. interests this year from ending joint military exercises to expelling a naval aid unit to forcing a U.S.-funded pro-democracy group to leave. On Thursday, Hun Sen said he was suspending cooperation with Washington to find the remains of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. According to the U.S Embassy, more than 500 Peace Corps volunteers have served and worked in Cambodia since 2006, providing English teaching and teacher training as well as community health education.  U.S. President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961 to promote world peace and friendship. ",

         "Australia to move 200 asylum seekers to new PNG detention center",
         "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Approximately two hundred men held in a remote Australian-run detention center will be moved to a new facility within weeks, the country s immigration minister said. Peter Dutton, Australia s immigration minister, said those men who have their refugee applications denied, ruling them ineligible for resettlement to the United States, and who are from countries such as Iran which precludes forced deportations, will be transferred to a new detention facility within Papua New Guinea (PNG) after Oct. 31.  Those people, who total about 200, who have been found not to be refugees are to be moved into an alternative place of detention away from the regional processing center,  Dutton told Australia s parliament. Dutton s comments mark the first insight into how Australia plans to manage the end of its policy of detaining asylum seekers in PNG, where 800 men are held, many of whom for four years. Canberra s hardline immigration policy requires asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia to be sent for processing at camps on PNG s Manus Island and on Nauru. They are told they will never be settled in Australia. Question marks remain, however, about the fate of the remaining men on Manus as a refugee swap deal with the United States stalls. Former U.S. President Barack Obama late last year agreed to resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in Australian immigration centers in PNG and Nauru. In exchange, Australia agreed to take Central American refugees. Australia had hoped the men would have been resettled by Oct. 31 but with the swap deal stalling under President Trump after the U.S. hit it annual intake cap, Canberra is left seeking a solution. Australia s security contract with Spanish company Ferrovial SA will expire on Oct. 31, forcing the closure of the camp that has been subject to violence from locals.  PNG officials have sought to transfer the men to a transit center nearby but nearly all, citing fears of violence, have refused despite threats that it may rule them out of U.S. resettlement.  We are not willing to move from the center unless we are leaving for a country that is safe,  said one, who declined to be identified because of the fear it would jeopardize his application for U.S. resettlement.

         "Brazil's Temer faces new graft charges over JBS testimony",
         "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer was charged with obstruction of justice and racketeering on Thursday, according to a statement posted on the prosecutor general s office website, threatening to delay the government s economic reform agenda in Congress.    It is the second set of criminal charges filed against the president based on the plea-bargain testimony of the owners of the world s largest meatpacker, JBS SA. They accused Temer of taking bribes in return for political favors and of conspiring to buy the silence of a witness who could implicate the leader.  In a statement on Thursday, Temer strongly rejected all allegations of wrongdoing.  Temer s earlier corruption charge, that he took bribes from JBS officials, was blocked in August by Temer s allies in the lower house of Congress, which has the power to decide whether a president should stand trial by the Supreme Court. Despite the lower house s move to block the charges, they remain valid and can be pursued by prosecutors once Temer leaves office. His term ends on Jan. 1, 2019. Brazil s top public prosecutor Rodrigo Janot has also filed charges against Joesley Batista, the billionaire former chairman of JBS who implicated Temer. Batista was arrested on Sunday for concealing other crimes in his plea bargain deal. Batista s lawyer Antonio Carlos Kakay rejected the charges brought by Janot, arguing in a statement that the prosecutor had violated the rules of plea bargains by using his client s testimony to incriminate him. On Wednesday, Batista s brother Wesley, the chief executive officer of JBS SA, was also arrested for alleged insider trading to avoid hefty losses related to the May plea deal. Late on Thursday, Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin converted Joesley and executive Ricardo Saud s temporary detentions into preventative detention and gave them 10 days to respond before ruling on Janot s request to withdraw their plea deal.   The arrests of the Batista brothers have improved Temer s prospects of surviving the new charges and serving out his term through 2018. Temer and his allies expect the new charges to be voted in the lower house next month with wider support than he obtained in the 263-227 vote last month blocking a trial. Fachin heeded a request from Temer s defense not to deliver the accusation to the lower house until after a supreme court plenary vote on the matter. The vote should be held before Wednesday. The allegations are part of Brazil s sprawling corruption probes that have resulted in ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva s conviction and four pending trials; investigations and charges implicating three former presidents and dozens of members of Congress; and guilty verdicts against well over 100 powerful business and political figures.      Most of the schemes involve political kickbacks in return for contracts at government-run enterprises or cheap loans from Brazil s state development bank.     The racketeering charge against Temer was based on the plea bargain testimony of L cio Funaro, a businessman who accused the president and his closest aides in the ruling PMDB party of operating a criminal organization to collect bribes in exchange for political influence.     The obstruction of justice charge was based on testimony by Joesley Batista that Temer endorsed payments of hush money to try to keep Funaro from talking.     A short legislative agenda ahead of an election year, the absence of public pressure to oust Temer and the lack of any convincing replacement for him are also likely to weigh in the president s favor.      Given the short timetable, the general public apathy and lack of a viable alternative, it is quite possible that Brasilia will continue to punt this down the road,  said Matthew Taylor, a professor at the American University in Washington.

         "Saviors or profiteers? Bangladesh fishermen rescue Rohingya, for a price",
         "SHAMLAPUR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - For tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims, an informal fleet of small wooden fishing boats has meant deliverance from what they say is an indiscriminate assault on their villages by the Myanmar army. Deliverance, however, comes at a price. Some refugees told Reuters they paid as much as 10,000 taka ($122) per adult to boatmen to make the five-hour crossing from Myanmar s coast to ports in southern Bangladesh. While the fishermen say they have a moral obligation to help desperate fellow Muslims escaping persecution, Bangladeshi officials accuse them of profiteering. Ordered to stamp out what they call human trafficking, they have made arrests and even set fire to fishing boats.  Of course we want to keep going back to rescue more people. Our Muslim brothers and sisters are in a bad situation, so I have to go and bring them,  said Mohammed Alom, 25, a fisherman in the Bangladeshi village of Shamlapur. Around 400,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh in less than three weeks and people are still coming, by land as well as by sea, after attacks by Rohingya militants sparked a fierce counteroffensive by Myanmar s army. Senior United Nations officials have described the violence as  ethnic cleansing . The influx is placing huge strain on authorities in southern Bangladesh, one of the poorest parts of a poor country.  Don t say rescuers. The rescuers should be going and they should rescue people, not in terms of money,  said Lieutenant Colonel Ariful Islam, Border Guards Bangladesh commander in Teknaf on the country s southern tip, referring to the fishermen bringing refugees ashore.  These people are very poor, it s just extorting from them whatever they have. We are helping those who arrived, but we re trying to insist that no human trafficking should take place.  Reuters interviewed three Rohingya fishermen and two Bangladeshi boat owner-operators, all of whom had made at least two visits to Myanmar in recent weeks. The men didn t believe the profits they made detracted from what they saw as a rescue mission. Shaif Ullah, 34, a Bangladeshi, who co-owns a fishing boat, said he made 100,000 taka ($1,220) rescuing the family of a Rohingya in Malaysia who paid him via BKash, a popular mobile money service, after he returned to Bangladeshi shores.  People from Malaysia and Saudi Arabia call me and tell me to go there to get their family,  he said.  They are crying for my help. I take money from them, yes, but it s also a humanitarian act.   Two refugees have told Reuters their family members were detained by fishermen or brokers in Bangladesh when they could not pay for the journey. Several also complained they had to hand over gold and other jewelry to boat operators.  We had no chance to negotiate with the boatmen,  said Ali Johar, 75, an elder from his village in southern Maungdaw, just across the Naf river that forms the border between Myanmar and Bangladesh, now staying in Shamlapur. He handed over his wife s gold necklace and a gold ring, in addition to 7,000 taka for the rescue of him and about 30 members of his extended family, including young children, he said.  But we are grateful to the fishermen for bringing us here,  he said.  There were so many people trying to get here. If they didn t bring us, we would be stuck.  Pronay Chakma says it was a  stroke of fate  that thrust him into a key role in Bangladesh s response to the crisis. The 31-year-old administrator arrived in Teknaf to start a new job as sub-district assistant commissioner for land on Aug. 23, two days before northwestern Myanmar exploded into violence.  The thing is that, yes, the fishermen can go there, no problem, but if they demand money from the pain of stricken people, is it humanitarian? No,  he said. Chakma - a Buddhist member of the Chakma tribe who live scattered throughout South Asia - is an executive magistrate, which means he can hand down jail terms in simple criminal cases. He interrupted an interview with Reuters to sentence a man to three months for possession of five methamphetamine tablets. Chakma and another local official have sentenced at least 100 people to terms of up to six months for continuing to charge Rohingya refugees for ferrying them to safety.  Each and every time we are warning them,  he said.  Yes, you can do that, but not in exchange of money.  He pointed to the deaths of women and children who, unable to swim, have died after their boats capsized near Bangladeshi shores. Fishermen and local residents told Reuters that authorities have also broadcast messages in their villages by loudspeaker ordering them not to pick up Rohingyas. At least five boats caught bringing refugees in exchange for money have been set on fire on the beach by officials. The boatmen Reuters spoke to said they were cautious about operating in bad weather and rejected allegations of coercion or detaining refugees. Tens of thousands of people may still be waiting to cross the mouth of the Naf river, according to estimates by refugees, fishermen and rights groups.  I would like to go back to bring these people, because Muslims are suffering,  said Bangladeshi boat owner Moni Ullah, 38.  For me, it s hard to sit here and not go there, because I have seen so many people crying on the beach.  ($1 = 81.9300 taka) ",

         "U.S. nuclear commander says assuming North Korea tested hydrogen bomb",
         "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (Reuters) - The U.S. general who oversees America s nuclear forces said on Thursday he was making the assumption that North Korea did in fact test a hydrogen bomb on Sept. 3, crossing a key threshold in its weapons development efforts.  Although Pyongyang immediately claimed it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, the United States had previously declined to characterize it.  Air Force General John Hyten, head of the U.S. military s Strategic Command, however, said he had a responsibility, as a military officer responsible for responding to the test, to assume that it was a hydrogen bomb, based on the size of the blast.  I m assuming it was a hydrogen bomb. I have to make that assumption as a military officer,  Hyten told a small group of reporters who were accompanying Defense Secretary Jim Mattie on a trip to Hyten s headquarters in Nebraska.  I m not a nuclear scientist, so I can t tell you this is how it worked, this is what the bomb was. ... But I can tell you the size that we observed and saw tends to me to indicate that it was a hydrogen bomb and I have to figure out what the right response is with our allies as to that kind of event.  The North Korean nuclear test, its sixth and by far most powerful, prompted the U.N. Security Council to step up sanctions. It followed a series of North Korean missile tests, including one that flew over Japan and another that the U.S. assessed to be an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM). South Korea s military said shortly after Hyten s remarks that North Korea fired an unidentified missile eastward from the Sunan district in its capital, Pyongyang. A hydrogen bomb usually uses a primary atomic bomb to trigger a secondary, much larger explosion. Such a weapon, with the first stage based on nuclear fission - splitting atoms - and the second on nuclear fusion, produces a blast that is much more power than traditional atomic bombs, or  pure fission  devices.  The sheer destruction and damage that you can create with a weapon that size is significantly of a concern,  Hyten said. Hyten said that despite the nuclear and missile tests, North Korea still had not demonstrated that it had a reliable ICBM that could deliver a nuclear warhead.  But he noted it was only a matter of time before its scientists achieved that, given the pace of testing.  It s just a matter of when, not if,  he said, adding it could be months or years. Experts doubt that President Donald Trump, like his predecessors, will be able to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear program through economic or diplomatic pressure. Current and former U.S. officials have declined to comment on operational planning but acknowledge that no existing plan for a preemptive strike could promise to prevent a brutal counterattack by North Korea, which has thousands of artillery pieces and rockets trained on Seoul. That raises the question of whether the United States might be able to live with a nuclear-armed threat from North Korea. A senior Trump administration official, speaking to reporters last week on condition of anonymity, said it was unclear whether the Cold War-era deterrence model that Washington used with the Soviet Union could be applied to a rogue state like North Korea, adding:  I don t think the president wants to take that chance.  Hyten, who would command U.S. forces in a nuclear war, expressed confidence in the U.S. nuclear deterrent.  Do we have the ability to deter North Korea from developing capabilities that could potentially threaten us? That s a different question,  he said.  But do I, U.S. Strategic Command, have the ability for the United States to deter an adversary from attacking the United States with nuclear weapons? Yes. Because they know the response is going to be the destruction of their entire nation.  ",

         "U.N. seeks 'massive' help for Rohingya fleeing Myanmar 'ethnic cleansing'",
         "DHAKA/YANGON (Reuters) - The United Nations appealed on Thursday for massive help for nearly 400,000 Muslims from Myanmar who have fled to Bangladesh, with concern growing that the number could keep rising, unless Myanmar ends what critics denounce as  ethnic cleansing . The Rohingya are fleeing from a Myanmar military offensive in the western state of Rakhine that began after a series of guerrilla attacks on Aug. 25 on security posts and an army camp in which about a dozen people were killed.  We urge the international community to step up humanitarian support and come up with help,  Mohammed Abdiker, director of operations and emergencies for the International Organisation for Migration, told a news conference in the Bangladeshi capital. The need was  massive , he added. The violence in Rakhine and the exodus of refugees is the most pressing problem Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced since becoming national leader last year. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday urged Myanmar to end the violence, which he said was best described as ethnic cleansing.       The government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejects such accusations, saying it is targeting  terrorists . Numerous Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine have been torched but authorities have denied that security forces or Buddhist civilians set the fires. They blame the insurgents, and say 30,000 non-Muslim villagers were also displaced. Smoke was rising from at least five places on the Myanmar side of the border on Thursday, a Reuters reporter in Bangladesh said. It was not clear what was burning or who set the fires.  Ethnic cleansing  is not recognized as an independent crime under international law, the U.N. Office on Genocide Prevention says, but it has been used in U.N. resolutions and acknowledged in judgments and indictments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. A U.N. panel of experts defined it as  rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups .       The crisis has raised questions about Suu Kyi s commitment to human rights, and could strain relations with Western backers supporting her leadership of Myanmar s transition from decades of strict military rule and economic isolation. Critics have called for her to be stripped of her Nobel prize for failing to do more to halt the strife, though national security remains firmly in the hands of the military. Suu Kyi is due to address the nation on Tuesday. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he had spoken with Suu Kyi and that she said she was working to get aid to areas affected by violence. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy had what one U.S. official called a  tough conversation  with Myanmar s ambassador to the United States on Wednesday ahead of Murphy s trip to Yangon this weekend. Murphy will be meeting with Myanmar government officials next week to voice concern about the state of the Rohingya people and to press for greater access for humanitarian workers and reporters, the State Department said. China, which competes with the United States for influence in Myanmar, endorses the offensive against the insurgents and deemed it an  internal affair , Myanmar state media said.  The counterattacks of Myanmar security forces against extremist terrorists and the government s undertakings to provide assistance to the people are strongly welcomed,  the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper quoted China s ambassador, Hong Liang, as telling government officials. But at the United Nations in New York, China set a different tone, joining a Security Council expression of concern about reports of violence and urging steps to end it. The council met on Wednesday to discuss the crisis and later  expressed concern about reports of excessive violence ... and called for immediate steps to end the violence in Rakhine, de-escalate the situation, re-establish law and order, ensure the protection of civilians ... and resolve the refugee problem . This week, the Trump administration called for protection of civilians. Bangladesh says the refugees will have to go home and has called for safe zones in Myanmar. Myanmar says safe zones are unacceptable. The IOM s Abdiker declined to say how many refugees he thought might end up in Bangladesh.  The number may rise to 600,000, 700,000, even one million if the situation in Myanmar does not improve,  he said. The most important thing was that the refugees be able to go home safely, said George William Okoth-Obbo, assistant high commissioner for operations at the U.N. refugee agency.  The international community has to support to ensure their return ... peacefully and with safety,  he told the news conference. On Wednesday, the Myanmar government said 45 places had been burned. It did not provide details, but a spokesman said out of 471 villages in the north of Rakhine, 176 had been deserted and at least some people had left 34 more. The spokesman, Zaw Htay, said the people going to Bangladesh were either linked to the insurgents, or women and children fleeing conflict. Government figures show 432 people have been killed, most of them insurgents, since Aug. 25. ",

         "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hurricane Max was downgraded to a tropical storm on Thursday evening, bearing down on a region with the popular tourist resorts of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa.  Max s maximum sustained winds decreased to 70 miles per hour (113 km per hour) on Thursday evening, and the storm was about 80 miles (129 km) east of Acapulco, the National Hurricane Center in Florida said. The storm is expected to continue weakening dramatically as it moves inland over Southern Mexico, and it will likely be downgraded to a tropical depression on Thursday evening.  Nevertheless, the center warned of heavy rains and flooding in the coastal states of Guerrero and Oaxaca.  In the state of Guerrero, home to some of Mexico s major tourist resorts, Max could dump as much as 20 inches (51 cm) of rain in coastal areas, the NHC said, potentially triggering flash floods and mudslides.  The storm is bad news for Acapulco as tourists prepare to travel to the city to celebrate Mexico s Independence Day this weekend.  Meanwhile, tropical storm Norma formed in the Pacific on Thursday, according to the NHC. The storm, which is currently 360 miles (579 km) south of Cabo San Lucas, on the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, could become a hurricane by late Friday.  Max arrives a week after a powerful 8.1-magnitude quake shook southern Mexico, destroying thousands of buildings in the state of Oaxaca and killing at least 98 people nationwide. ",

         "Western powers press Iraq Kurd leaders to shelve 'very risky' independence vote",
         "ERBIL/KIRKUK, Iraq (Reuters) - The United States and Western allies pressed Iraqi Kurdish leaders to ditch a  very risky  independence vote on Thursday, presenting an alternative plan in an attempt to avoid conflict between the oil rich region and central government in Baghdad. The referendum, slated for Sept. 25, has become a potential flashpoint in the region, with Western powers concerned it could ignite conflict with Baghdad and divert attention from the war against Islamic State militants.  Heading into a referendum for Sept. 25, there is no prospect for international legitimacy,  Brett McGurk, a U.S. special envoy, told reporters after a delegation also including the U.N. and Britain met Kurdish President Massoud Barzani.  This is a very risky process.  McGurk said he was encouraged that Kurdish leaders could embrace an alternative plan focusing on dialogue between the Kurdistan region and Baghdad and a delay in the referendum. He refused to give details.  The Kurdish presidency said the autonomous region s political leaders would study the proposal, without giving details. But Barzani himself was later quoted by local media as telling a pro-independence rally the vote would go ahead on Sept. 25 as planned. The move came after Iraq s parliament voted to remove the governor of Kirkuk, a staunch supporter of Kurdish independence. Kirkuk Governor Najmaddin Kareem said he had no intention of following Baghdad s dismissal order, issued at the behest of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.  I will stay in office,  he told Reuters.  The referendum will go on as planned...The prime minister does not have the power to ask parliament to remove me.  Iraqi lawmakers authorized Abadi this week to  take all measures  to preserve national unity before the independence referendum.   Baghdad and Iraq s neighbors are opposed to the vote.      Iraqi lawmakers say it will consolidate Kurdish control over several disputed areas, including oil-rich Kirkuk. Turkey has the region s largest Kurdish population and fears a  Yes  vote could fuel separatism in its southeast where Kurdish militants have waged an insurgency for three decades in which more than 40,000 people have been killed. Iran and Syria also oppose the vote, fearing it could fan separatism among their own Kurdish populations. Iraqi lawmakers say the referendum will consolidate Kurdish control over several disputed areas, including oil-rich Kirkuk. Kirkuk province is claimed by both the central government in Baghdad and Barzani s semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq. Kareem is a vocal supporter of the referendum and campaigned for the vote also to be held in Kirkuk. Kurds have long claimed Kirkuk and its huge oil reserves. They regard the city, just outside their Kurdistan region in northern Iraq, as their historical capital.  But the ethnically mixed city also has Arab and Turkmen populations. Kareem has long riled the federal government. Last spring, Kirkuk s governorate voted to raise the Kurdish flag over state buildings, despite Baghdad s insistence that only Iraq s national flag should fly in the multi-ethnic city.    He (Kareem) is an elected governor of the council of Kirkuk,  said Hoshyar Zebari, a close adviser to President Barzani.  That is the only body that can remove him.   The escalating tactics this week by the Iraqis are causing a large public backlash, and will strengthen the Kurdish referendum enormously,  Zebari said.  Kurdish MPs in Iraq s parliament boycotted Thursday s vote, which produced a majority for the governor s removal, lawmaker Husham al-Suhail told Reuters. Asked whether parliament had the right to dismiss Kareem, Suhail referred to an article of Iraq s provincial law, which  parliament used as the legal basis for the vote and which stipulates the prime minister s authority to remove a regional governor. Suhail gave no details about what Kareem was accused of and Kareem himself said he had not been informed.  This is unlawful ... I have the support of the government council, I have the support of the people, we are here and we will continue,  he said. ",

         "TARRAGONA, Spain (Reuters) - The Catalonian government on Thursday launched its official campaign for an independence referendum, which Madrid has declared illegal, buoyed by the support of the capital  Barcelona. Crowds filled a bull ring in the northeastern city of Tarragona, applauding and shouting  We will vote!  as regional president Carles Puigdemont arrived to rally support for the Oct. 1 vote. In a boost for the credibility of the referendum, the mayor of Barcelona said earlier on Thursday that the vote would go ahead in the city, having previously expressed concern that civil servants involved may lose their jobs. A town hall spokesman was unable to comment further or explain how civil servants could be protected.      Puigdemont himself is facing criminal charges of misuse of public money, disobedience and abuse of office for organizing the referendum, and prosecutors have summoned hundreds of the region s mayors for questioning.    Police raided a newspaper office and a printing press last week, looking for signs of preparation, and the regional court has ordered Civil Guard agents to shut down web pages providing information about the referendum.  Regional home affairs councillor Joaquim Forn said there was a bigger than usual presence of national police in Catalonia.  They are moving throughout the region. They must be looking for ballot boxes,  he told RAC1 radio. A majority of Catalonia s 5.5 million voters want to have their say on the northeastern region s relationship with Spain, but the independence cause has lost support in recent years and surveys indicate less than 50 percent of the population would choose full self-rule.

         "North Korea threatens to 'sink' Japan, reduce U.S. to 'ashes and darkness'",
         "SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - A North Korean state agency threatened on Thursday to use nuclear weapons to  sink  Japan and reduce the United States to  ashes and darkness  for supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution and sanctions over its latest nuclear test. The Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, which handles the North s external ties and propaganda, also called for the breakup of the Security Council, which it called  a tool of evil  made up of  money-bribed  countries that move at the order of the United States.  The four islands of the archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche. Japan is no longer needed to exist near us,  the committee said in a statement carried by the North s official KCNA news agency.   Juche is the North s ruling ideology that mixes Marxism and an extreme form of go-it-alone nationalism preached by state founder Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong Un. Regional tension has risen markedly since the reclusive North conducted its sixth, and by far its most powerful, nuclear test on Sept. 3, following a series of missile tests, including one that flew over Japan. The 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on a U.S.-drafted resolution and a new round of sanctions on Monday in response, banning North Korea s textile exports that are the second largest only to coal and mineral, and capping fuel supplies. The North reacted to the latest action by the Security Council, which had the backing of veto-holding China and Russia, by reiterating threats to destroy the United States, Japan and South Korea.  Let s reduce the U.S. mainland into ashes and darkness. Let s vent our spite with mobilization of all retaliation means which have been prepared till now,  the statement said. Japan s Nikkei stock index and dollar/yen currency pared gains, although traders said that was more because of several Chinese economic indicators released on Thursday rather than a reaction to the North s latest statement. South Korea s won also edged down around the same time over domestic financial concerns. Despite the North s threats, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he was against having nuclear weapons in his country, either by developing its own arsenal or bringing back U.S. tactical nuclear weapons that were withdrawn in the early 1990s.  To respond to North Korea by having our own nuclear weapons will not maintain peace on the Korean peninsula and could lead to a nuclear arms race in northeast Asia,  Moon said in an interview with CNN. South Korea s Unification Ministry also said it planned to provide $8 million through the U.N. World Food Programme and UNICEF to help infants and pregnant women in the North. The move marks Seoul s first humanitarian assistance for the North since its fourth nuclear test in January 2016 and is based on a longstanding policy of separating humanitarian aid from politics, the ministry said. The North s latest threats also singled out Japan for  dancing to the tune  of the United States, saying it should never be pardoned for not offering a sincere apology for its  never-to-be-condoned crimes against our people , an apparent reference to Japan s wartime aggression. It also referred to South Korea as  traitors and dogs  of the United States. Japan criticized the North s statement harshly.  This announcement is extremely provocative and egregious. It is something that markedly heightens regional tension and is absolutely unacceptable,  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, visiting India, called for strict enforcement of the U.N. resolution, saying the world must force a change. The 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on a U.S.-drafted resolution and a new round of sanctions against North Korea on Monday in response to its latest and most powerful test, banning North Korea s textile exports that are the second largest only to coal and mineral, and capping fuel supplies. North Korea had already rejected the Security Council resolution, vowing to press ahead with its nuclear and missile programs. A tougher initial U.S. draft of Monday s resolution was weakened to win the support of China, the North s lone major ally, and Russia. Significantly, it stopped short of imposing a full embargo on oil exports to North Korea, most of which come from China. The latest sanctions also make it illegal for foreign firms to form commercial joint ventures with North Korean entities. U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed that North Korea will never be allowed to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile, but has also asked China to do more to rein in its neighbor. China in turn favors an international response to the problem. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the international community had reached a  high consensus  on trying to realize a peaceful solution.  We urge the relevant directly involved parties to seize the opportunity and have the political nerve to make the correct political choice as soon as possible,  Hua told a regular press briefing. The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty.

         "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Thursday that his country had accepted Israel s offer to help it and the United States develop Central America, as Israel and Mexico seek to deepen business ties. Speaking at a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Pena Nieto added that the two nations had agreed to update their free trade agreement, which was signed in 2000.  We have agreed to establish and begin the ... negotiations to look over this agreement so that the commercial relationship between both nations intensifies and grows,  he said. Netanyahu was joined by a business delegation including representatives from communications firm AudioCodes Ltd, cyber security firm Verint Systems Inc and Mer Group, which specializes in telecommunications and cyber security. In Central America, Pena Nieto said Israel s assistance could bolster the United States and Mexico s efforts in the region, particularly in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. He noted that Israel brings experience from carrying out development projects in Africa. The United States and Mexico have been seeking to encourage investment in infrastructure improvements in Central America s so-called Northern Triangle in an effort to stem migration to the United States. Netanyahu s trip marked the first visit to Mexico by a sitting Israeli prime minister, Pena Nieto said. At the close of the news conference, Netanyahu invited Pena Nieto to Jerusalem. The relationship between the nations was strained earlier this year by a tweet in which Netanyahu appeared to praise U.S. President Donald Trump s plans to build a wall on the Mexican border. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin later issued a statement apologizing for any misunderstanding. ",

         "U.S. extends some Iran sanctions relief under nuclear deal",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday extended some sanctions relief for Iran under the 2015 nuclear deal but said it has yet to decide whether to preserve the deal itself, the State Department said. President Donald Trump, who must make a decision by mid-October that could undermine the agreement, said Iran is violating  the spirit  of the 2015 deal under which Iran got sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear program. In a sign of Trump s desire to put pressure on Iran, which denies violating the deal, the U.S. Treasury announced new cyber-related and other sanctions on seven Iranian individuals, two Iranian entities and two Ukraine-based entities.  We are not going to stand for what they are doing,  Trump told reporters on Air Force One. But he stopped short of saying whether he will refuse to recertify the agreement. Trump must decide in October whether to certify that Iran is complying with the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). If he does not, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. The prospect of Washington reneging on the agreement has worried some of the key U.S. allies that helped negotiate the deal, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis, North Korea s nuclear and ballistic missile development. Republican Senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and wrote the law giving Congress the right to review the Iran deal, said he and the White House were preparing in case of a change in policy. He also said he recognized the need to work with allies.  I think it s important that ... we take steps that, to the extent we can, we keep all of our allies together,  Corker told Reuters.  What you don t want to do is self-create a crisis for no reason. You want to make sure that you have an outcome here that is a good outcome for the United States and our interest.  Asked if it made sense to abandon the Iran nuclear deal given concerns about North Korea, Corker said,  I don t think you should prejudge what they re (the administration) going to do.  Separately, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson argued that the United States must consider the full threat it says Iran poses to the Middle East when formulating its new policy toward Tehran, saying Iran had breached the spirit of the deal.  We have to consider the totality of Iran s activities and not let our view be defined solely by the nuclear agreement,  he told a news conference in London. Citing the preface to the 2015 agreement, Tillerson said  in our view, Iran is clearly in default of these expectations.  He cited Iranian support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, its development of ballistic missiles and  cyber activities.  The deal s preface does not oblige Iran to promote global peace. Rather, it says the nations involved  anticipate that full implementation of this JCPOA will positively contribute to regional and international peace and security.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters the administration had approved waivers of some sanctions on Iran to  maintain some flexibility  as it develops its Iran policy. She did not specify which sanctions were waived. Earlier, sources said the United States will renew a waiver of the most punitive sanctions on Iran. Tucked into Section 1245 of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, Washington threatened to sanction the banks of Iran s main oil customers if they did not significantly cut their purchases of Iranian crude. Under the law, these sanctions can be waived for a maximum of 120 days, forcing the U.S. government to revisit the issue every four months. Even as the administration waived the oil-related sanctions, the Treasury Department announced it had sanctioned 11 entities and individuals for  engaging in support of designated Iranian actors or malicious cyber-enabled activity.  Of the 11, seven were Iranian individuals, two were Iranian entities and two were entities based in Ukraine. The Treasury alleged they either supported Iran s ballistic missile program or its Quds Force, or engaged in cyber attacks against the U.S. financial system. The action freezes any assets they may hold in the United States and generally prohibits U.S. individuals from doing business with them. ",

         "LONDON (Reuters) - Myanmar is facing a  defining moment  and must stop the violence against its ethnic minority Rohingya population, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday. Attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts last month triggered an army operation that has killed more than 400 people, destroyed over 6,800 houses and sent nearly 400,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh. On a visit to London where he met British Prime Minister Theresa May and foreign minister, Boris Johnson, he told a news conference:  I think it is a defining moment in many ways for this new, emerging democracy.  He said he understood that Myanmar s Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel prize laureate and de facto head of the government in Myanmar, was in a power-sharing agreement with the military and the  complex situation  in which she found herself.  I think it is important that the global community speak out in support of what we all know the expectation is for the treatment of people regardless of their ethnicity,  he added.

         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An American citizen fighting for Islamic State in Syria surrendered to U.S-backed fighters earlier this week and has been handed over to U.S. forces, the Pentagon said on Thursday. The American surrendered to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of mostly Arab and Kurdish fighters, on or around Sept. 12.  The US citizen is being legally detained by Department of Defense personnel as a known enemy combatant,  Pentagon spokesman Major Adrian Rankine-Galloway said in a statement. It is not the first time an American citizen fighting for the group has been detained by U.S. allies. In June, a Virginia man who traveled to Syria to become a suicide bomber for Islamic State was convicted of providing material support to the militant group. Mohamad Jamal Khweis, 27, spent about 2-1/2 months in early 2016 traveling with Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq and participating in the group s religious training. He was detained by Kurdish peshmerga forces in northern Iraq in March 2016 and turned over to U.S. authorities. ",

         "Irma creates bittersweet travel bonus for luckier Caribbean islands",
         "(Reuters) - On Friday, a cruise ship carrying around 3,000 passengers will dock at St. John s harbor in the Caribbean island of Antigua. It will not be where the passengers expected to land when they booked, however. The Carnival Plc ship was meant to dock in Saint Martin, 100 miles (160 km) to the northwest. However, Hurricane Irma devastated the island, wrecking its port and infrastructure, and leaving it out of bounds for tourists. Antiguan officials now expect the Carnival Fascination to visit every Friday, and have gotten about 25 calls from major cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd and Norwegian Cruise Lines looking to make stops through the end of the year. For Asot Michael, Antigua and Barbuda s minister for tourism, the unexpected arrival of thousands of tourists is a bittersweet bonus.  We are going to be benefiting. I don t want to benefit from others  misfortune after such a disaster,  Michael said.  But because the port is so damaged in Saint Martin, so damaged in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands, we re getting some of those cancellations. Those cruise lines now are making ports of call into Antigua.      Hurricane Irma left behind a stark divide in the Caribbean ahead of the winter tourism season that is the region s economic lifeblood. As travel to the region picks up again, cruise lines, hotels, airlines and other companies are directing customers to places that are able to host them, and away from the worst-hit areas.  Popular winter vacation spots such as Saint Martin, the British Virgin Islands and Saint Barthelemy that were devastated by the storm could be sidelined for weeks or months.  In 2016, 29.3 million tourists visited the Caribbean and spent $35.5 billion, both new records, according to the Caribbean Tourism Organization.   For Saint Martin and Saint Bart, the holiday season looks very compromised,  said Jean-Pierre Mas, chairman of French travel agency federation SNAV.  My sentiment is that the winter season is lost. Decisions to book for the winter season are taken right now.   Busy tourist destinations in the western Caribbean, such as Barbados and Trinidad, were well away from the path of the storm. Cozumel, on Mexico s Gulf Coast, got four additional visits this week as ships were rerouted to avoid the storm s impact, although Cozumel tourism officials said three cruises were canceled.  Florida, which was anticipating another record year for its $100 billion a year tourism industry, is expected to rebound in time for the peak winter travel months, Moody s Analytics said earlier this week. Walt Disney Co reopened its Orlando Disney World theme park on Sept. 12. The Florida Keys, however, wrestled with more severe storm damage. [nL2N1LR0N1] [nF9N1L0029] [nL2N1LS1HW] Some travel companies said they are still assessing the situation and had not made firm decisions about rerouting ships. Tour operator Virgin Holidays said that it was beginning to return to regular operations in Antigua, despite damage to some properties on the island.  Antigua wasn t as badly damaged as we feared, and we have reopened tourism there, although three resorts are currently not on sale because of the damage,  a spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said.  Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia are three big tourist examples that were not impacted.  However, the small island of Saint Martin, which France shares with the Netherlands, could miss out on much of its tourism season. French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday vowed to swiftly rebuild the islands of the French Caribbean, including Saint Martin, and a French public reinsurance body estimated a cost of at least 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) from the damage there and in Saint Barthelemy. [nL2N1LT1SF] [nL5N1LQ09G] Hurricane Irma badly damaged many hotels on the island, such as AccorHotels Mercure hotel. A spokeswoman for Accor said that while nobody had been hurt, the hotel would be closed until Jan. 8 at least.  While 70 hotel rooms remain operational, they are being used to house military forces and other staff that are supporting the relief effort. AccorHotels is offering cancellation and reimbursement for those who had booked stays at the hotel. ",

         "Irma shakes Havana's deadly crumbling buildings",
         "HAVANA (Reuters) - Roydis Vald s  dilapidated home on Animas Street in the densely packed center of Old Havana had been declared uninhabitable by Cuba s Communist authorities years ago, his neighbors said. After Hurricane Irma shook the Cuban capital - a crumbling architectural jewel of the Caribbean - Vald s and his brother  were found under a collapsed wall, just two of the seven people killed by falling buildings on the island. Havana s historic center, where baroque Spanish colonial-era palaces butt shoulders with sleek Art Deco apartment buildings, was already crumbling before it took a lashing from Irma - a visible reminder of the hardship caused by a 57-year U.S. trade embargo.  Residents fear the violent storm - the worst to hit the Cuban mainland since 1932 - will accelerate the city s decline. While the eye of the hurricane did not reach the capital, tropical-storm force winds and heavy rains of its outer bands, as well as a storm surge, wrought havoc on its decrepit buildings. Salty water from Irma s heavy rains that has seeped into the brick and mortar of the capital s buildings will worsen corrosion and likely cause a raft of new collapses, residents and architects warn.  Now when the sun comes out, that s when things will really start to fall apart in Havana,  said Berta Rodriguez, a 71-year-old pensioner who lives on Animas Street and knew Vald s and his brother well.  We spent years asking the state to remove them from there,  she said, crying.  The state has to answer for this.      Irma has shone an unwelcome spotlight on the Caribbean nation s housing problems at a tricky time for the government. Already dealing with a cash crunch in the wake of a steep decline in aid from its key ally, Venezuela, Cuba also faces a political transition as President Raul Castro steps down next year, symbolizing the passing of the baton from the generation that led the 1959 Revolution. Rodriguez, who evacuated to her son s sturdier home during the hurricane, says she has been asking the Communist authorities for a new home for more than 20 years, echoing the frustrations of many Havana residents. After the Revolution led by Raul Castro s elder brother Fidel, the Cuban state confiscated many of Havana s grand historic buildings and distributed them to poor and middle-class families who over the years have divided them into ever-smaller units. Maintaining those buildings in a punishing tropical climate, however, fell by the wayside as the Communist government prioritized universal healthcare and education, as well as building infrastructure in the impoverished countryside. With state salaries averaging $30 per month and credit hard to get, Cubans say they do not have the money to fix up buildings themselves.  A builder told me I need to repair the walls that are full of holes, but I couldn t find the cash,  said Rodriguez, who suffers from chronic bronchitis made worse by her badly leaking ceiling. About 4,400 cases of damage to housing were reported in the capital due to Irma, state-run media said on Thursday. Of those, authorities confirmed nearly 1,200 buildings were entirely or partially destroyed. The city is working on restoring damaged roofs and preparing two shelters for families left homeless, the newspaper Granma added. But this will solve only part of a far greater problem. The housing deficit in the nation of 11 million people rose last year by 30,000 to nearly 900,000 units, the government told parliament in July.  In Havana, it estimated a shortage of more than 200,000 homes. The state had built 316,595 homes between 1990 and 2013, an effort that the president of the Construction Commission Santiago Lajes Choy told parliament was still  insufficient.  Litza Penalver, whose sister s family lives in the building on Animas street partially destroyed by Irma, said authorities want to get residents out now.   They want to demolish it, to cover up their errors,  she said.  They want to oblige us to stay in a large shelter and wait (for a new house) but the wait can last 30 years - Cuba doesn t have the resources.  Many Havana residents say they would prefer to stay in their decrepit homes, no matter how dangerous, rather than move to large shelters that offer no privacy. Still, with the rainy season ongoing, many worry that more hurricanes could hit before it ends in November.  While Irma has exacerbated frustration with Cuba s housing problems, even dissidents say it is unlikely to fuel outright opposition to the government.  There might be more spontaneous, isolated expressions of discontent,  said Jose Daniel Ferrer, leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), one of the island s largest dissident groups.  But not organized protests with clear political aims given the high level of repression at the moment.  Rodriguez, Penalver and others on Animas Street said theirs was not a political problem and noted they were strong supporters of the Revolution that toppled right-wing dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959 and subsequently provided free healthcare and education to ordinary Cubans.  I love my country,  said Penalver, adding she had a Spanish passport but chose to live in Cuba.  I m not looking for political problems. I m looking for solution to the housing issue.  ",

         " (In this Sept. 13 story, corrects definition of intersex in paragraph 5.) SYDNEY (Reuters) - The alarming volume of hate-speech during Australia s ballot over whether to legalize same-sex marriage spurred parliament  to pass emergency legislation on Wednesday to outlaw opponents spewing their vitriol while the vote was in progress. Australia began a non-compulsory postal vote on Tuesday that will determine whether it becomes the 25th country to legalize same-sex marriage. But with an emotionally charged campaign raising concerns about the welfare of vulnerable Australians, the government moved to strengthen laws preventing hate-speech. The opposition Labor Party supported the amendment, though it had rejected the need for a ballot on the issue. Until voting ends on November 7, anyone found guilty of intimidation, or threats to cause harm on the basis of the sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status - people who are born with genetic, hormonal or physical sex characteristics that are not typically male or female - or the religious convictions of someone will be liable to fines of A$12,500 (over $10,000) and a court injunction.  This bill cannot stop all of the hurt, all of the prejudice that is being expressed, all of the lack of acceptance that is being communicated to LGBTI Australians, to same-sex couple families. But it provides limited protections,  said Penny Wong, leader of the opposition in the senate. ",

         "LONDON (Reuters) - The United States must consider the full threat it says Iran poses to the Middle East when formulating its new policy toward Tehran, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday, adding that Iran had breached the spirit of a 2015 nuclear deal.  Tillerson, made the comments during a visit to Britain to see Prime Minister Theresa May and foreign minister Boris Johnson. The trip was billed as focusing on the relief effort after Hurricane Irma, how to respond to North Korea s nuclear test, and resolving the political deadlock in Libya. But he was outspoken in his criticism of Iran when asked whether he believed it was meeting the obligations of a 2015 international nuclear agreement designed to curb an Iranian nuclear program in return for lifting most Western sanctions. Tillerson cited the preface of the nuclear deal, which calls on Iran to contribute positively to regional security.   In our view, Iran is clearly in default of these expectations ... through their actions to prop up the Assad regime (in Syria), to engage in malicious activities in the region, including cyber activities, aggressively developing ballistic missiles,  he told a news conference.  We have to consider the totality of Iran s activities and not let our view be defined solely by the nuclear agreement.  He was speaking before the United States announced it had imposed sanctions on seven Iranian individuals and two entities, alleging involvement in either malicious cyber activities or enabling Tehran s ballistic missile program. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously expressed doubts about the nuclear deal, and in April his administration said it would review whether the lifting of sanctions against Iran was in the United States  national security interest. Trump is weighing a strategy that could allow more aggressive U.S. responses to Iran s forces, its Shi ite Muslim proxies in Iraq and Syria, and its support for militant groups. Earlier on Thursday, a North Korean state agency threatened to reduce the United States to  ashes and darkness  for supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution and sanctions over its latest nuclear test. Tillerson said he was hopeful that China would decide to use the  powerful tool  of oil supplies to put pressure on Pyongyang, but conceded that it would be difficult to agree an oil embargo through the United Nations Security Council. North Korea carried out its sixth and largest nuclear test earlier this month.  I am hopeful that China, as a great country, a world power, will decide on their own, will take it upon themselves to use that very powerful tool of oil supply to persuade North Korea to reconsider its current path towards weapons development, reconsider its approach to dialogue and negotiations in the future,  he said. Commenting on violence in Myanmar against the minority Rohingya population, Tillerson said the country faced a defining moment.  I think it is important that the global community speak out in support of what we all know the expectation is for the treatment of people regardless of their ethnicity,  he added.  This violence must stop, this persecution must stop.  He said he understood that Myanmar s Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel prize laureate and de facto head of the government in Myanmar, was in a power-sharing agreement with the military and it was a  complex situation  in which she found herself.

         "DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen s Houthi leader Abdel-Malek al-Houthi said on Thursday his group could target Saudi oil tankers should Saudi Arabia attack Yemen s main port at Hodeidah.   We could target Saudi oil tankers and we could do anything,  he said.  In a televised speech, the leader also said his group s ballistic missiles were capable of reaching the United Arab Emirates  capital of Abu Dhabi and anywhere inside Saudi Arabia.  It was unclear whether the Houthi group has the capability to carry out its threats. Abdel Malek said the Houthis had successfully fired a missile at Abu Dhabi earlier this month, meaning the United Arab Emirates was no longer safe from attack. He gave no further details and there has been no indication by the UAE of any missiles landing on their territory.  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter his country was not intimidated by Houthi threats.  The Houthis  comments threatening the UAE and its capital are tangible proof of the need for the Decisive Storm (operation),  Gargash said, referring to the Saudi-led coalition intervening in Yemen.  Iran s militias have vile objectives and represent a real threat,  he added. Yemen has been devastated by more than two years of civil war in which President Abd Rabu Hadi s government, backed by the coalition, is fighting to drive the Iran-allied Houthis out of cities they seized in 2014 and 2015 in a rapid rise to national power.  Today the port of Hodeidah is being threatened and we cannot turn a blind eye to that,  Abdel-Malek said.   If the Saudi regime and with a green light from the U.S. attack Hodeidah then we have to take steps that we haven t taken before.   The United Nations had proposed that the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, where 80 percent of food imports arrive, should be handed to a neutral party, to smooth the flow of humanitarian relief and prevent the port being engulfed by Yemen s two-year-old war. The government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi accuses the Houthis of using the port to smuggle in weapons and of collecting custom duties on goods, which they use to finance the war. The Houthis deny this. ",

         "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia accused the West on Thursday of  whipping up hysteria  over large-scale military exercises underway in eastern Europe and denied charges that they were being conducted with a lack of transparency. The exercises, codenamed \"Zapad\", or \"West\", started on Thursday and will last until Sept. 20. They are being conducted  on military ranges in Belarus, western Russia, Russia's exclave of Kaliningrad and in the Baltic Sea. (For graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2iIkjEU)  We reject complaints of these exercises not being transparent,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  We believe that whipping up hysteria around these exercises is a provocation.   It is a normal practice for any country to hold such exercises. Everything is being held in line with international law,  Peskov said. Russian President Vladimir Putin may visit one of the stages of these drills, he said.     NATO is closely watching the exercises and says they are larger than the 12,700 servicemen Moscow has publicized, actually numbering some 100,000 troops, and involve firing nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. Russia s defense ministry reiterated on Thursday that the exercises are of a purely defensive nature and are not a threat to any third country or group of countries. But NATO officials say the drills will simulate a conflict with the U.S.-led alliance intended to show Russia s ability to mass large numbers of troops at short notice in the event of a conflict. In a statement, the Pentagon said that while Russia and Belarus had taken some steps towards providing transparency, there were concerns about the official estimate of troop numbers.  We urge Russia to share information regarding its exercises and operations in NATO s vicinity to clearly convey its intentions and minimize any misunderstandings,  Lieutenant Colonel Michelle Baldanza, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in a statement.   In response to this uncertainty, the U.S. has built a joint, persistent rotational presence of air, land, and sea presence in the region to support our Allies,  she added. Amid allegations about Moscow s aggressive ambitions from its post-communist neighbors, Russia s defense ministry has said that it does not intend to use the drills as a springboard to attack Lithuania, Poland or Ukraine. Moscow says it is the West that threatens stability in eastern Europe, because NATO has put a 4,000-strong multinational force in the Baltics and Poland. Russia s defense ministry said the current drills involve some 7,200 troops from Belarus and 5,500 from Russia, up to 70 aircraft and helicopters, up to 680 units of military hardware, including 250 tanks, up to 200 artillery pieces, multiple rocket launchers and mortars, and up to 10 warships.

         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials are aggressively investigating what caused symptoms ranging from hearing loss to mild brain injury in 21 people linked to the U.S. Embassy in Cuba, a State Department official said on Thursday. Spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing that no new incidents had been reported since late August but testing continued, with 21 people saying they had been injured in what some media accounts have called an  acoustic attack.   We are, at the State Department, very deeply concerned about what has taken place and what has happened to our American personnel who have been serving at our embassy in Cuba,  Nauert said.  This has certainly turned out to be a difficult situation for some of our people.  The incidents, which began in late 2016, were first confirmed by a U.S. official in August. Nauert said at that time 16 people had been injured. Some of those had returned home for testing and treatment, Nauert said, while others had been tested in Cuba, where the embassy has a fulltime medical officer. News media have reported that Americans and Canadians working in Cuba have been diagnosed with hearing loss, nausea, headaches, balance disorders and conditions as serious as mild traumatic brain injury and damage to the central nervous system.  The investigation into all of this is still underway. It is an aggressive investigation that continues and we will continue doing this until we find out who or what is responsible for this,  Nauert said. She said U.S. diplomatic security personnel had been able to look through the rooms of some of those injured and conducted searches but still had not determined the cause of the injuries. Nauert said people were still being tested and it was possible the number of injured personnel would rise. ",

         "Fearing Russia, Sweden holds biggest war games in 20 years",
         "GOTHENBURG, Sweden (Reuters) - Neutral Sweden has launched its biggest war games in two decades with support from NATO countries, drilling 19,000 troops after years of spending cuts that have left the country fearful of Russia s growing military strength. On the eve of Russia s biggest maneuvers since 2013, which NATO says will be greater than the 13,000 troops Moscow says are involved, Sweden will simulate an attack from the east on the Baltic island of Gotland, near the Swedish mainland.  The security situation has taken a turn for the worse,  Micael Byden, the commander of the Swedish Armed Forces, said during a presentation of the three-week-long exercise.  Sweden, like the Baltics, Poland and much of the West, has been deeply troubled by Russia s 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Black Sea peninsula Crimea and its support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.   Russia is the country that affects security in Europe right now with its actions - the annexation of the Crimea and continued battles in eastern Ukraine - so it is clear that we are watching very closely what Russia is doing,  Byden said.  Around 1,500 troops from the United States, France, Norway and other NATO allies are taking part in the exercise dubbed Aurora. Non-NATO member Sweden has decided to beef up its military after having let spending drop from over 2 percent of economic output in the early 1990s to around 1 percent, and is re-introducing conscription. The armed forces, which at one point could mobilise more than 600,000, stand at just 20,000, with 22,000 more Home Guard volunteers.   NATO generals say the Aurora exercise is not a response to Russian exercises that start on Thursday. But Byden, speaking as U.S. and French forces displayed mobile surface-to-air missile systems to be deployed during the exercise, stressed the importance of NATO for Sweden.   We are a sovereign country that takes care of and is responsible for our safety. We do this together with others, ready to both support and receive help,  he said. The United States shipped vehicles by sea from Germany, while France brought others by train. They are to be moved via a classified route to Sweden s east coast for the exercise where U.S. attack helicopters will play the enemy during Aurora.  The government is determined to stick to the country s formal neutrality. Sweden has not fought a war since it clashed with Norway in 1814. But like its non-NATO neighbor Finland, Sweden has been drawing closer to NATO, allowing closer cooperation with alliance troops, with a view to working together in the event of an armed conflict. ",

         "SCALIA FOUND DEAD With ‘Pillow Over Head’ By Millionaire Democrat Donor…No Autopsy…Possible Ways Scalia Could Have Been Killed",
         "Justice Scalia appeared to be in good health prior to his vacation at the Cibolo Creek Ranch in Texas owned by Texas millionaire businessman and Democrat donor John Poindexter. Many believe the timing of his death is too coincidental. After reading the details provided and sourced below, share your thoughts with us in the comment section below.It has been long-standing policy for the Obama administration to grant presidential awards to those who are among the president s most prized political donors.It was Poindexter who reportedly was among those who initially discovered the Justice s body, and who then coordinated with local officials to have Justice Scalia declared dead via a phone conversation with the area medical examiner   but without an actual medical examination of the body.Mr. Poindexter was also said to be the primary point man between the ranch location and federal authorities who were notably slow to arrive on scene.If Elizabeth Price Foley at Instapundit is correct,  Barack Obama could indeed make a recess appointment to replace Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court thanks to a Recess Appointments Clause.Under S. Con. Res. 31, the only way to recall the Senate back into business before February 22 is with the  concurrence [of] the Minority Leader of the Senate,  Harry Reid (D-NV). Somehow I doubt Sen. Reid will grant such concurrence to reconvene, should President Obama decide to use this 10-day recess to make a recess appointment and replace Justice Scalia. But should President Obama try use this particular 10-day recess to replace Justice Scalia, the replacement would only be constitutionally permitted to serve until the end of the next session  i.e., until the end of the 1st session of the 115th Congress, which would be sometime in early January 2018. Via: InstapunditSo, in other words the timing of the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia couldn t have been better In the cloistered chambers of the Supreme Court, Justice Antonin Scalia s days were highly regulated and predictable. He met with clerks, wrote opinions and appeared for arguments in the august courtroom on a schedule set months in advance.Yet as details of Scalia s sudden death trickled in Sunday, it appeared that the hours afterward were anything but orderly. The man known for his elegant legal opinions and profound intellect was found dead in his room at a hunting resort by the resort s owner, who grew worried when Scalia didn t appear at breakfast Saturday morning.It then took hours for authorities in remote West Texas to find a justice of the peace, officials said Sunday. When they did, Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara pronounced Scalia dead of natural causes without seeing the body   which is permissible under Texas law   and without ordering an autopsy.As official Washington tried to process what his demise means for politics and the law, some details of Scalia s final hours remained opaque. As late as Sunday afternoon, for example, there were conflicting reports about whether an autopsy should have been performed. A manager at the El Paso funeral home where Scalia s body was taken said that his family made it clear they did not want one.One of two other officials who were called but couldn t get to Scalia s body in time said that she would have made a different decision on the autopsy. If it had been me . . . I would want to know,  Juanita Bishop, a justice of the peace in Presidio, Tex., said in an interview Sunday of the chaotic hours after Scalia s death at the Cibolo Creek Ranch, a luxury compound less than an hour from the Mexican border and about 40 miles south of Marfa.Meanwhile, Guevara acknowledged that she pronounced Scalia dead by phone, without seeing his body. Instead, she spoke to law enforcement officials at the scene   who assured her  there were no signs of foul play    and Scalia s physician in Washington, who said that the 79-year-old justice suffered from a host of chronic conditions. He was having health issues,  Guevara said, adding that she is awaiting a statement from Scalia s doctor that will be added to his death certificate when it is issued later this week.Guevara also rebutted a report by a Dallas TV station that quoted her as saying that Scalia had died of  myocardial infarction.  In an interview with The Washington Post, she said she meant only that his heart had stopped. It wasn t a heart attack,  Guevara said.  He died of natural causes.  Via: Washington PostThe absence of an autopsy will stoke the fires of conspiracy, but they may be doused later this week when a statement from Scalia s doctor will be added to his death certificate. The 79-year-old jurist suffered from several chronic conditions, The Washington Post reported.Also intriguing to theorists: The U.S. Marshal said that Scalia had declined any security at the ranch. This opens up a host of possible, if extremely long-shot, murder scenarios where an interloper arrives at the ranch and escapes unseen.Scalia was not a young man. He was 79 years old and friends at the West Texas ranch where he died say he went to bed early because he didn t feel well. There are many natural causes of death that could be responsible. A heart attack seems to be the most probable cause, and local media are reporting that his death certificate will read  myocardial infarction.  Other media reports say the cause will be deemed natural. Either way, no official is suggesting homicide.Let s not let that stop us from conjecture. Besides, there are also a few man-made ways to kill him that would fit the very thin facts   some of which would be hard to prove even if examiners conducted an autopsy.Many conspiracy-minded people are pointing to a small detail to throw some suspicion over Scalia s death: a pillow found over his head. So could someone have entered his room and used that pillow to asphyxiate him? This method only really works with really old or young people, or those already unconscious. There are usually telltale signs of these murders   not only will most victims struggle, leaving signs of the fight behind, but the suffocation takes up to 5 minutes and the body shows this with hemorrhages under the skin. But there s a catch: Sometimes the suffocation triggers a heart attack, leaving the corpse without many of the signs of a homicide.Even a close examination can miss this cause of death.  Homicidal smothering is extremely difficult to detect,  reads one book on forensic pathology written by Dinesh Rao.  The autopsy may reveal asphyxia, but there may not be any corroborative medical evidence to prove foul play. Assassination by poison is an ancient art form. It s also a good way to kill people without getting caught. Let s say you re the professional killer hired by   oh, let s just go the whole way and blame this on the White House. They might ask how you plan on doing this. Well,  the killer would respond,  I m a trained nurse and I m a big fan of this muscle relaxant called succinylcholine. It s the stuff we inject into patients when we want to jam breathing tubes down their throats while they re still awake. But get this: In high enough doses, it paralyses people so they can t breath. Most autopsies show this as a heart attack. It s brilliant.  The White House aide smiles.  Then let s take out that SOB. Sound far-fetched? Well, sure. But a similar scheme killed Nevada State Controller Kathy Augustine when her husband injected her with succinylcholine. The hubby was nabbed when coworkers reported that he was pondering ways to kill her, and looked more closely at her body. They found a small needle mark.The drug doesn t leave any direct traces, but it breaks down and leave metabolites behind that can indicate a poisoning. But the medical examiner has to be looking for those signs to catch them during an autopsy.The paranoid can also ponder whether Scalia could have been killed with a gas. One easy choice would be to use carbon monoxide poisoning, undetectable by smell or color. There have been cases where a murderer has run a hose from the tailpipe of a car into a room where the victim is sleeping. (A doctor in Ohio named Mark Wangler did this in 2006 and got caught, mostly because his claim that the victim had a seizure was proven false. Prosecutors showed that she was dead when the call was made.) All a hired killer would need is a commercially available canister of carbon monoxide and a hose.There s a catch, though. There are usually telltale signs when a person is killed by CO. There may be froth at the mouth and nose. (The kind of evidence absorbed by a pillow perhaps?) The skin and internal organs can become bright red, almost like a stain. It s unlikely that such clues would be ignored by an M.E.Since Scalia s family has declined an autopsy, America will likely never know the truth In 2006, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  acknowledged a specific death threat against her and her retired colleague Sandra Day O Connor, blaming lawmakers for fueling  the irrational fringe. She said the court s marshal, Pamela Talkin, alerted her and O Connor to a February 28, 2005, Internet chat posting by an unidentified person to his fellow  commandoes  urging a  patriotic assignment. According to Ginsburg, the Web author criticized the justices  prior reference of international laws, saying,  This is a huge threat to our Republic and Constitutional freedom.   If you are what you say you are, and NOT armchair patriots, then those two justices will not live another week. The threat came amid growing concern in the judicial community over the personal safety of judges and court personnel. A federal judge s husband was murdered in Illinois in 2005, by an angry litigant. Less than two weeks later, a shooting spree in Georgia left a judge, a court reporter and a deputy dead in a county courtroom.Deadly anthrax spores were mailed to the Supreme Court s building in 2001, prompting the building to be evacuated for several weeks.",

scalia declared dead via a phone conversation with the area medical examiner   but without an actual medical examination of the bodymr poindexter was also said to be the primary point man between the ranch location and federal authorities who were notably slow to arrive on sceneif elizabeth price foley at instapundit is correct  barack obama could indeed make a recess appointment to replace justice scalia on the supreme court thanks to a recess appointments clauseunder s con res  the only way to recall the senate back into business before february  is with the  concurrence of the minority leader of the senate  harry reid dnv somehow i doubt sen reid will grant such concurrence to reconvene should president obama decide to use this day recess to make a recess appointment and replace justice scalia but should president obama try use this particular day recess to replace justice scalia the replacement would only be constitutionally permitted to serve until the end of the next session  ie until the end of the st session of the th congress which would be sometime in early january  via instapunditso in other words the timing of the death of supreme court justice antonin scalia couldn t have been better in the cloistered chambers of the supreme court justice antonin scalia s days were highly regulated and predictable he met with clerks wrote opinions and appeared for arguments in the august courtroom on a schedule set months in advanceyet as details of scalia s sudden death trickled in sunday it appeared that the hours afterward were anything but orderly the man known for his elegant legal opinions and profound intellect was found dead in his room at a hunting resort by the resort s owner who grew worried when scalia didn t appear at breakfast saturday morningit then took hours for authorities in remote west texas to find a justice of the peace officials said sunday when they did presidio county judge cinderela guevara pronounced scalia dead of natural causes without seeing the body   which is permissible under texas law   and without ordering an autopsyas official washington tried to process what his demise means for politics and the law some details of scalia s final hours remained opaque as late as sunday afternoon for example there were conflicting reports about whether an autopsy should have been performed a manager at the el paso funeral home where scalia s body was taken said that his family made it clear they did not want oneone of two other officials who were called but couldn t get to scalia s body in time said that she would have made a different decision on the autopsy if it had been me    i would want to know  juanita bishop a justice of the peace in presidio tex said in an interview sunday of the chaotic hours after scalia s death at the cibolo creek ranch a luxury compound less than an hour from the mexican border and about  miles south of marfameanwhile guevara acknowledged that she pronounced scalia dead by phone without seeing his body instead she spoke to law enforcement officials at the scene   who assured her  there were no signs of foul play    and scalia s physician in washington who said that the yearold justice suffered from a host of chronic conditions he was having health issues  guevara said adding that she is awaiting a statement from scalia s doctor that will be added to his death certificate when it is issued later this weekguevara also rebutted a report by a dallas tv station that quoted her as saying that scalia had died of  myocardial infarction  in an interview with the washington post she said she meant only that his heart had stopped it wasn t a heart attack  guevara said  he died of natural causes  via washington postthe absence of an autopsy will stoke the fires of conspiracy but they may be doused later this week when a statement from scalia s doctor will be added to his death certificate the yearold jurist suffered from several chronic conditions the washington post reportedalso intriguing to theorists the us marshal said that scalia had declined any security at the ranch this opens up a host of possible if extremely longshot murder scenarios where an interloper arrives at the ranch and escapes unseenscalia was not a young man he was  years old and friends at the west texas ranch where he died say he went to bed early because he didn t feel well there are many natural causes of death that could be responsible a heart attack seems to be the most probable cause and local media are reporting that his death certificate will read  myocardial infarction  other media reports say the cause will be deemed natural either way no official is suggesting homicidelet s not let that stop us from conjecture besides there are also a few manmade ways to kill him that would fit the very thin facts   some of which would be hard to prove even if examiners conducted an autopsymany conspiracyminded people are pointing to a small detail to throw some suspicion over scalia s death a pillow found over his head so could someone have entered his room and used that pillow to asphyxiate him this method only really works with really old or young people or those already unconscious there are usually telltale signs of these murders   not only will most victims struggle leaving signs of the fight behind but the suffocation takes up to  minutes and the body shows this with hemorrhages under the skin but there s a catch sometimes the suffocation triggers a heart attack leaving the corpse without many of the signs of a homicideeven a close examination can miss this cause of death  homicidal smothering is extremely difficult to detect  reads one book on forensic pathology written by dinesh rao  the autopsy may reveal asphyxia but there may not be any corroborative medical evidence to prove foul play assassination by poison is an ancient art form it s also a good way to kill people without getting caught let s say you re the professional killer hired by   oh let s just go the whole way and blame this on the white house they might ask how you plan on doing this well  the killer would respond  i m a trained nurse and i m a big fan of this muscle relaxant called succinylcholine it s the stuff we inject into patients when we want to jam breathing tubes down their throats while they re still awake but get this in high enough doses it paralyses people so they can t breath most autopsies show this as a heart attack it s brilliant  the white house aide smiles  then let s take out that sob sound farfetched well sure but a similar scheme killed nevada state controller kathy augustine when her husband injected her with succinylcholine the hubby was nabbed when coworkers reported that he was pondering ways to kill her and looked more closely at her body they found a small needle markthe drug doesn t leave any direct traces but it breaks down and leave metabolites behind that can indicate a poisoning but the medical examiner has to be looking for those signs to catch them during an autopsythe paranoid can also ponder whether scalia could have been killed with a gas one easy choice would be to use carbon monoxide poisoning undetectable by smell or color there have been cases where a murderer has run a hose from the tailpipe of a car into a room where the victim is sleeping a doctor in ohio named mark wangler did this in  and got caught mostly because his claim that the victim had a seizure was proven false prosecutors showed that she was dead when the call was made all a hired killer would need is a commercially available canister of carbon monoxide and a hosethere s a catch though there are usually telltale signs when a person is killed by co there may be froth at the mouth and nose the kind of evidence absorbed by a pillow perhaps the skin and internal organs can become bright red almost like a stain it s unlikely that such clues would be ignored by an mesince scalia s family has declined an autopsy america will likely never know the truth in  supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg  acknowledged a specific death threat against her and her retired colleague sandra day o connor blaming lawmakers for fueling  the irrational fringe she said the court s marshal pamela talkin alerted her and o connor to a february   internet chat posting by an unidentified person to his

constitutional freedom   if you are what you say you are and not armchair patriots then those two justices will not live another week the threat came amid growing concern in the judicial community

         " Road Raging Texas ‘Good Guy With A Gun’ Shoots Woman In The Head, Leaves Her For Dead",
         "A University of North Texas student is in critical condition after one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  shot her in the head during a roadway dispute. According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times",

         "Exclusive: Special counsel Mueller to probe ex-Trump aide Flynn's Turkey ties",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating possible ties between the Trump election campaign and Russia, is expanding his probe to assume control of a grand jury investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, three sources told Reuters. The move means Mueller’s politically charged inquiry will now look into Flynn’s paid work as a lobbyist for a Turkish businessman in 2016, in addition to contacts between Russian officials and Flynn and other Trump associates during and after the Nov. 8 presidential election.      Federal prosecutors in Virginia are investigating a deal between Flynn and Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin as part of a grand jury criminal probe, according to a subpoena seen by Reuters.  Alptekin’s company, Netherlands-based Inovo BV, paid Flynn’s consultancy $530,000 between September and November to produce a documentary and research on Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Turkish cleric living in the United States. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan blames Gulen for a failed coup last July.  Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, told Reuters he hired Flynn to provide research on how Gulen is “poisoning the atmosphere” between Turkey and the United States. Gulen has denied any role in the coup and dismisses Turkey’s allegations that he heads a terrorist organization. The grand jury in Virginia has issued subpoenas to some of Flynn’s business associates involved in the work for Inovo, two people familiar with the probe say. The subpoena seen by Reuters seeks bank records, documents and communications related to Flynn, his company, Flynn Intel Group, Alptekin and Inovo. Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to questions about Flynn’s work for Inovo or Mueller’s investigation. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. Alptekin declined to comment when asked about the investigation into Flynn and whether he or anyone he knows has been subpoenaed.  Mueller’s move to take over the Virginia grand jury’s criminal investigation highlights his broad powers as special counsel. Reuters could not determine when the grand jury was first convened, but its existence has been previously reported. Until now the investigation has been led by Brandon van Grack, an espionage prosecutor in the Justice Department, and federal prosecutors from the Eastern District of Virginia. It is not clear whether Van Grack and others who have been working on the case will continue to do so. Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, on May 17 to oversee an investigation into any links or collusion between Russia and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Rosenstein also gave him authority to pursue “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.” Some members of Congress have asked the Justice Department to define the scope of Mueller’s inquiry. Mueller’s appointment followed an uproar over Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Democrats and some of the president’s fellow Republicans had demanded an independent probe of whether Russia tried to sway the outcome of November’s election in favor of Trump and against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump, who has said there was no coordination between his campaign and Russia, has decried the investigation as a “witch hunt.” One of Trump’s most trusted aides during the election campaign, Flynn had a long career in the military. He set up the Flynn Intel Group, an Alexandria, Virginia-based intelligence consultancy, after President Barack Obama dismissed him as head of the military’s Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. Mueller, who takes over leadership of an FBI investigation that began last July, can present evidence to grand juries and hear testimony from witnesses. Trump fired Flynn in February after it became clear that he had falsely characterized the nature of phone conversations he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, just after the Obama administration imposed new sanctions on Russia for what U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded was a Kremlin-led effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost Trump’s chances of winning the White House.  Flynn’s work for Inovo came under scrutiny after he published a commentary on a political news website on Election Day calling Gulen a “radical Islamist” who should be extradited to Turkey. Along with the editorial, the Flynn Intel Group also produced a 75-page report on Gulen based mainly on news reports and some video footage for a documentary that was never made, according to three people familiar with the project. Alptekin, who is chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, told Reuters he was satisfied with Flynn’s research because it had helped him understand how Gulen’s network operates in the United States. He said the $530,000 payment to Flynn’s firm came “mostly” from his personal funds. The rest came from Inovo’s corporate revenues, Alptekin said.     On Nov. 18, the day after Flynn was appointed Trump’s national security adviser, Trump transition team lawyer William McGinley raised concerns on a call with the Flynn Intel Group and others involved in the Inovo project over who had paid for  Flynn’s commentary, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation. Flynn did not participate in that call, they said.     At the time of the call, Flynn had not disclosed that his work for Alptekin meant he was being paid to represent Turkish interests during the election campaign. Flynn Intel Group had said in a September 2016 filing that it was lobbying for Inovo but did not disclose its Turkish links. In March, Flynn retroactively registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In a letter accompanying the March filing, Flynn’s lawyer, Kelner, said the disclosure was being made because Flynn’s work for Inovo “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey,” which he noted was seeking to extradite Gulen.     The House of Representatives intelligence committee, which is also investigating  Russian interference in the election, subpoenaed records from Flynn on Wednesday. The Senate’s intelligence committee, which has a separate probe under way, has also served subpoenas on Flynn and two of his businesses, and earlier this week Flynn indicated that he would start turning over relevant materials.

         "German parties see momentum in coalition talks despite lingering divisions",
         "BERLIN (Reuters) - German parties cited progress on Friday after three weeks of talks about a three-way coalition, with their leaders due to thrash out remaining differences over transport and climate on Sunday. Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, which bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the Sept. 24 election, are trying to forge a coalition government with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the environmentalist Greens. The chiefs of the parties huddled on Friday evening to review progress in the talks thus far, but planned no statements.  They had initially hoped to agree on the outlines of a coalition deal by Friday after the two smaller parties dropped demands this week on tax and climate policy, but later decided to meet again on Sunday before a final push by full delegations for an outline deal next week. Still, the overall tone was more upbeat than at the end of the previous week.  We re heading into the home stretch,  Horst Seehofer, head of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU), told reporters. Seehofer and FDP leader Christian Lindner said they were optimistic that the exploratory talks could be wrapped up next week, paving the way for weeks of detailed negotiations about the exact terms of a coalition contract. But Michael Kellner, a top negotiator for the Greens, demanded more compromises from the other parties. The FDP this week gave ground by agreeing to accept more modest income tax cuts than a campaign pledge of 30-40 billion euros ($35-46 billion) of relief.  In an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel on Friday, Lindner also signaled a readiness to compromise on the euro zone s European Stability Mechanism, moving away from a campaign pledge to shut down the rescue fund. The Greens for their part dropped their insistence on fixed dates for shutting down coal-fired power stations and banning cars with internal combustion engines. But the parties remain divided on whether or not to push for a euro zone budget, on Europe s banking union and on the use of drones in military conflicts, as well as German participation in   foreign military missions, according to draft papers seen by Reuters. They must also agree how to meet key targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, how to deal with the pollution caused by diesel cars already on the road, and whether to introduce a law that would ease tax rates for venture capital projects. If the parties fail to reach agreement, Germany could be forced into a new election that could unsettle investors at a time when many in the European Union are looking to Europe s biggest economic power for leadership on issues ranging from euro zone governance to transatlantic relations. Merkel, seeking a fourth term as chancellor, hopes to reach agreement in the exploratory talks by Nov. 16. She plans to take the broad outlines of what is agreed to key conservative party leaders in five meetings the following weekend, the CDU said. ",

         "Bonkers! Watch MSNBC Anchor Lawrence O’Donnell’s Unhinged Outtakes [Video]",
         "Lawrence O Donnell had a really bad night on August 29, 2017. We draw that conclusion based on the clip below showing behind the scenes footage of a furious O Donnell absolutely going bananas in what appear to be breaks in his show.The video, which lasts a full eight minutes, is a collection of clips from one evening given O Donnell s consistent outfit and show the MSNBC anchor fuming about earpiece malfunctions, blasting off obscenities and screaming at his staff. We were able to link it back to the August 29 show.After introducing a clip about President Donald Trump, O Donnell pauses, and during what one can presume was the clip going on air, a sudden flush of anger creeps onto his face. What s going on, why am I losing this, why don t I have sound,  he starts, voice rising.  Who s asking for a Labor Day rundown in my ear? God dammit,  he mutters, shaking his head, before bursting into a brief spasm of fury and slamming his fists on the desk.In the next clip, O Donnell finishes up a segment, and declares:  There s insanity in the control room tonight.  He then begins to visibly shake with anger, but manages to hold his tongue, and continues reading from the prompter. You have insanity in my earpiece,  O Donnell then seethes through tightly drawn lips.  Fuckin. The pattern continues in subsequent clips, with O Donnell continuing to complain angrily about someone talking into his earpiece.And then. STOP THE HAMMERING!  O Donnell cries suddenly, in response to a knocking sound running faintly in the background.He then stands up and launches into a shouted tirade past the camera. STOP THE HAMMERING UP THERE. WHO S GOT A HAMMER? WHERE IS IT? WHERE S THE HAMMER? GO UP ON THE OTHER FLOOR. SOMEBODY GO UP THERE AND STOP THE HAMMERING. STOP THE HAMMERING. I LL GO DOWN TO THE GODDAMNED FLOOR MYSELF AND STOP IT, KEEP THE GODDAMNED COMMERCIAL BREAK GOING. CALL FUCKING PHIL GRIFFIN, I DON T CARE WHO THE FUCK YOU HAVE TO CALL. STOP THE HAMMERING. EMPTY OUT THE GODDAMNED CONTROL ROOM AND FIND OUT WHERE THIS IS GOING ON. Phil Griffin is the president of MSNBC. Fucking out of control shit,  O Donnell adds.In the next and final wild piece, O Donnell complains about the editing of a clip, wringing a piece of paper into a tight roll and throwing it to the ground. Jesus Christ,  he then says as he adds a pen to the things he chooses to slam on his desk.  Crazy fucking sound coming in my ear, this fucking stupid hammering. It just fucking sucks,  O Donnell laments, staring down at his desk.  It fucking sucks to be out here with this out of control shit.

         "This is hands down the best commentary yet on the Democrats and the crooked, defiant and arrogant Hillary. The Democrats are notorious for being a party that refuses to back down, and they re not backing down now, even if it means losing the respect and trust of an entire nation. Party first. That s how its always been with the Dems, and their circle of protection, including lie after lie that is being told to defend her only proves that there are no exceptions to that rule Has America become so numb by the decades of lies and cynicism oozing from Clinton Inc. that it could elect Hillary Clinton as president, even after Friday s FBI announcement that it had reopened an investigation of her emails while secretary of state?We ll find out soon enough.It s obvious the American political system is breaking down. It s been crumbling for some time now, and the establishment elite know it and they re properly frightened. Donald Trump, the vulgarian at their gates, is a symptom, not a cause. Hillary Clinton and husband Bill are both cause and effect.FBI director James Comey s announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign. That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious.This can t be about pervert Anthony Weiner and his reported desire for a teenage girl. But it can be about the laptop of Weiner s wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin, and emails between her and Hillary. It comes after the FBI investigation in which Comey concluded Clinton had lied and been  reckless  with national secrets, but said he could not recommend prosecution.So what should the Democrats do now?If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process:They would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place.Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea.Since Oct. 7, WikiLeaks has released 35,000 emails hacked from Clinton campaign boss John Podesta. Now WikiLeaks, no longer a neutral player but an active anti-Clinton agency, plans to release another 15,000 emails.What if she is elected? Think of a nation suffering a bad economy and continuing chaos in the Middle East, and now also facing a criminal investigation of a president. Add to that congressional investigations and a public vision of Clinton as a Nixonian figure wandering the halls, wringing her hands.The best thing would be for Democrats to ask her to step down now. It would be the most responsible thing to do, if the nation were more important to them than power. And the American news media   fairly or not firmly identified in the public mind as Mrs. Clinton s political action committee   should begin demanding it.But what will Hillary do?She ll stick and ride this out and turn her anger toward Comey. For Hillary and Bill Clinton, it has always been about power, about the Clinton Restoration and protecting fortunes already made by selling nothing but political influence.She ll remind the nation that she s a woman and that Donald Trump said terrible things about women. If there is another notorious Trump video to be leaked, the Clintons should probably leak it now. Then her allies in media can talk about misogyny and sexual politics and the headlines can be all about Trump as the boor he is and Hillary as champion of female victims, which she has never been.Remember that Bill Clinton leveraged the  Year of the Woman.  Then he preyed on women in the White House and Hillary protected him. But the political left   most particularly the women of the left   defended him because he promised to protect abortion rights and their other agendas.If you take a step back from tribal politics, you ll see that Mrs. Clinton has clearly disqualified herself from ever coming near classified information again. If she were a young person straight out of grad school hoping to land a government job, Hillary Clinton would be laughed out of Washington with her record. She d never be hired.As secretary of state she kept classified documents on the home-brew server in her basement, which is against the law. She lied about it to the American people. She couldn t remember details dozens of times when questioned by the FBI. Her aides destroyed evidence by BleachBit and hammers. Her husband, Bill, met secretly on an airport tarmac with Attorney General Loretta Lynch for about a half-hour, and all they said they talked about was golf and the grandkids.And there was no prosecution of Hillary.That isn t merely wrong and unethical.

         " Senate Republicans Blast Donald Trump’s Racist, Dangerous Muslim Ban With Full Force",
         "Public pressure is mounting on Congressional leaders after Donald Trump issued his racist, xenophobic, and idiotic executive order. The order, signed on Friday, bars refugees, immigrants or green card holders from entering the United States if they come from Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Iran, Sudan and Yemen.Shortly after the issue, plans arriving across the United States  busiest airports carrying Syrian families, international students, and dual-citizens were met with hostile authorities. Either sent back on the next flight out, detained for hours on end, and belittled by federal agents, Muslim refugees were subject to the wrath of Donald Trump.At first, only the Democrats (not surprisingly) spoke out. But as public outcry grew into spur-the-moment rallies across the United States, Republicans were forced to take notice.Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a centrist who refused to support Trump during the campaign, spoke out first, saying in a press release:The worldwide refugee ban set forth in the executive order is overly broad and implementing it will be immediately problematic. [It] could interfere with the immigration of Iraqis who worked for American forces in Iraq as translators and bodyguards   people who literally saved the lives of our troops and diplomats during the last decade and whose lives are at risk if they remain in Iraq  As I stated last summer, religious tests serve no useful purpose in the immigration process and run contrary to our American values.Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse, who refused to endorse Trump, lambasted the Administration for lacking  wisdom  with the action:There are two ways to lose our generational battle against jihadism by losing touch with reality. The first is to keep pretending that jihadi terrorism has no connection to Islam or to certain countries. That s been a disaster. And here s the second way to fail: If we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion. Both approaches are wrong, and both will make us less safe. Our generational fight against jihadism requires wisdomArizona Senator Jeff Flake, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and also refused to endorse Trump, blasted the executive action as  unacceptable,  saying:President Trump and his administration are right to be concerned about national security, but it s unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry. Enhancing long term national security requires that we have a clear-eyed view of radical Islamic terrorism without ascribing radical Islamic terrorist views to all Muslim.Arizona s other (and more hawkish) Senator, John McCain, took to Facebook to denounce the order, joining with Senator Lindsey Graham, writing:Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism. At this very moment, American troops are fighting side-by-side with our Iraqi partners to defeat ISIL. But this executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies. Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.When you ve lost John McCain, you know there s a problem. Although the sentiments expressed by the Senate Republicans are accurate and reflect what should be shared by 100% of their caucus, their words come a little too late. It became apparent that Trump s chief adviser, Steve Bannon, had his grubby, racist little hands all over it. Rudy Giuliani admitted on Fox News that Donald Trump knows this is a Muslim ban   he wanted one in the most  legal  way possible. Yet he continues to insist it is not a Muslim ban.What the Republicans also fail to note (or admit) is that the ban is just flat out racist.It s a good start, nut statements won t do a thing. It s time for them to come together with the Democrats to pass meaningful legislation and send a real message to the Trump White House.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",

         " Trump Jr. Just ‘Liked’ Tweet Praising Mosque Shooting In Quebec; The Reason Why Is Even Worse (IMAGE)",
         "When it comes to how shameless the Trump family seems to be, it seems to be limitless. They seem to only care about what effects them personally, and how powerful they can become at whatever cost comes to others along the way.What Donald Trump Jr. just  Liked  on Twitter is just more proof of this.As several Muslims in Quebec, Canada, perished in a Mosque shooting, many mourned this loss. It was a horrific act of violence, and no one should ever have to be a part of such a thing.However, having no heart and clearly no grasp of the details of the situation, Trump Jr. decided he would appreciate how much political capital could come out of this if the shooter was Muslim.The tweet Trump Jr.  Liked  reads as such: When it s revealed that the #QuebecShooting terrorists are Muslims, #Trump will have a tremendous spike in political capital. #MuslimBan via TwitterTrump Jr. seems to not so much care about the loss of life, but rather about the fact that his dad could score some political points.This is what a sociopath looks like.As it turns out, the shooter wasn t Muslim, and was, in fact, an extremist white guy who is a fan of Donald Trump. This isn t to say that Trump s anti-Muslim rhetoric here in the United States is what led to the shooting, but it certainly is an interesting, and very concerning, coincidence.It s disgusting that one of the first thoughts out of Donald Trump Jr. s brain was how he could use people dying to his dad s advantage.

         "Trump says he was against Iraq war despite Howard Stern interview",
         "CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday said he was against the Iraq war all along despite telling radio interviewer Howard Stern in 2002 that he favored it. Trump used the start of a speech about education at a charter school in Cleveland to push back at Democratic rival Hillary Clinton’s statement that his position on Iraq is pretty much like her own: She voted for the 2003 war as a U.S. senator from New York but has since disavowed the vote. At an NBC forum on Wednesday night, Clinton pointed to a September 2002 interview Trump gave to radio host Howard Stern to say that Trump had supported the war. Trump had said “Yeah, I guess so,” when asked about a potential conflict in Iraq.  Various fact-checkers have cited this interview to debunk Trump’s statement that he was always against the war. In Cleveland, Trump cited a Jan. 28, 2003, interview he did with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto to say he was skeptical. In that interview, Trump said: “I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.” He said in his Cleveland remarks that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq had left a power void filled by Islamic State militants. “But I was opposed to that war from the beginning, long before my interview with Howard Stern,” Trump said. He also cited what he said was a March 25, 2003, interview. “Just days after the war started, I was quoted as saying the war is a mess,” Trump said, calling it “more evidence that I had opposed the war from the start.” ",

         "Senior national security official to leave Justice Department",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Justice Department official who oversaw efforts to prosecute Islamic State sympathizers and pursue cyber criminals is leaving the Obama administration next month, he told Reuters on Tuesday. Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, chief of the national security division at the Justice Department, is departing on Oct. 15, less than a month before the U.S. presidential election.     The departure comes as the Obama administration has struggled to develop clear guidelines on how to pursue hacking amid growing threats posed by foreign nation-states and criminal groups. In an interview, Carlin, 43, declined to say where he was headed next. He intends to spend time with his family before starting a new job, likely involved in cyber security, he said. Carlin, who has served in government for more than 15 years, oversaw a range of prominent cases in three and a half years since assuming an acting rank of the Justice Department’s top national security lawyer in March 2013, including the prosecution of one of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombers.  He was confirmed full-time to the position in a 99-1 vote by the U.S. Senate in April 2014.  Carlin focused on pursuing cyber criminals during his tenure running the national security division.  His tenure included the unprecedented indictment of five Chinese military hackers in 2014 for alleged hacking into six U.S. companies in order to steal trade secrets, and the indictment of Iranian hackers earlier this year for alleged hacks on U.S. financial institutions and a New York dam. In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Carlin was a “trusted and tireless leader” who “used all the tools at his disposal to enhance our public safety and uphold our national security.” Carlin will be replaced by Mary McCord, principal deputy assistant attorney general, on an acting basis, the Justice Department said. Through a combination of legal cases, diplomatic sanctions and an effort to publicly name and shame hacking adversaries, Carlin sought to tame what he often called the wild west of cyberspace, where international norms for appropriate cyber activity are nascent or nonexistent. “We’ve laid a strong foundation in cyber, but we’ve got to do more, faster, given the state of the threat,” Carlin told Reuters. He said he hoped the next presidential administration could further “institutionalize” consequences from cyber crime. Most recently Carlin announced this month the formation of a threat analysis team to study potential national security challenges posed by self-driving cars, medical devices and other Internet-connected tools. Carlin’s appointment in early 2014 coincided with territorial gains by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria that propelled the militant group to global notoriety. Since then, the department has prosecuted dozens of people on counts related to Islamic State: more than 100 people have been charged since 2014 in public federal cases.  Under Carlin, the national security division has also ramped up the Justice Department’s efforts to combat what it sees as a rising threat from domestic anti-government extremists. ",

         "Pleas to flee, a desperate video: Inside Venezuela's oil industry purge",
         "CARACAS (Reuters) - Days before masked agents arrested him, family and friends pleaded with Eulogio Del Pino to flee, warning that he could be next among executives detained or pursued, one after another, in a mounting purge of Venezuela s faltering oil industry. But the former oil minister, detained by police before dawn on Nov 30, was reluctant to believe he could soon be among those targeted in what President Nicolas Maduro has characterized as a cleanup of the all-important sector.  I told him:  Go! ,  said one of three people who described the leadup to the former minister s detention.  But he told me  I haven t done anything wrong. I trust that they re not going to do anything bad to me.  That trust, the product of three years in which Del Pino held the top two jobs in Venezuela s oil ministry, now appears alarmingly misplaced. Maduro is charging Del Pino and many other former industry executives with corruption and blaming them for economic woes now crippling the Andean nation.  I m not going to shield anyone,  Maduro said in a speech on Nov 28, as he swore in a general who replaced Del Pino as oil minister.  If you re corrupt, you have to pay with jail and return what you ve stolen.  The crackdown has led to uncertainty, panic and paranoia across the sector, with as many as 65 former executives arrested over the past four months. Prosecutors, critics say, have provided scant evidence for the charges.  Corruption has long plagued the OPEC member s oil industry and much of the broader Maduro government, a leftist administration struggling with an imploding economy, soaring crime and debilitated public services. But critics of Maduro s beleaguered administration, and many within the oil industry itself, see the purge as nothing more than an effort to eliminate rivals within the sector and consolidate control ahead of presidential elections next year.  Maduro wants control of PDVSA and control of its cash flow,  said opposition legislator and economist Angel Alvarado, using the initials for state-controlled oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Venezuela s Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. PDVSA and the oil ministry did not respond to requests for comment either.  It is not clear whether any of the charges against Del Pino are substantiated. Prosecutors, without presenting any evidence, accused him of belonging to a  cartel  that operated a roughly $500 million corruption scheme in the western state of Zulia.  But the Stanford-educated engineer, who led the ministry until Nov. 26 and PDVSA for three years before that, was previously known as a government loyalist, committed to Maduro s vision for  21st century socialism.  Only after he was ousted from the ministry, the three people familiar with his arrest said, did Del Pino finally begin to believe that his time was probably up. His final days as a free man illustrate how swiftly fortunes can shift for even senior officials in Maduro s government. Just after his firing, Del Pino told Reuters in a WhatsApp message:  I need a rest.        On Nov. 29, three days after his ouster, an exhausted Del Pino went to Avila, a verdant mountain that towers over Caracas, the capital, where he liked to hike, one of the people said. Del Pino found a quiet spot under a tree and recorded a video on his cell phone. He said he believed he was about to become a  victim  of an  unjustified attack.   Before sunlight the following morning, hooded and armed military intelligence agents burst into his home and arrested him. Footage of the detention showed Del Pino wearing the burgundy-colored soccer shirt of Venezuela s national team. Later that day, the video Del Pino recorded appeared on his Twitter account.  I hope the revolution will give me the right to a legitimate defense,  he said, referring to the government in the militant terms embraced by Maduro.  Del Pino did not respond to requests for comment on WhatsApp, where he had recently changed his profile picture from one of him in a PDVSA hat to one of his children. After Del Pino s detention, stunned workers at PDVSA s Caracas headquarters, where he was generally well-liked, watched the state TV footage on screens in company elevators.  Fear has gripped employees at both institutions, according to a half-dozen current and former PDVSA insiders as well as foreign oil executives. Managers are scared to sign routine documents in case it could be used against them. Maduro promoted Del Pino, who was born in the Canary Islands and holds a Spanish passport, from PDVSA s exploration and production division to the company s top job in 2014.  At the time, foreign oil executives and analysts largely welcomed the arrival of the genial and low-profile technocrat. He replaced Rafael Ramirez, a once-powerful loyalist of the late Hugo Chavez, Maduro s predecessor.  Ramirez, who dominated Venezuela s oil industry for a decade, sought to make PDVSA  redder than red.  He urged  workers to wear red shirts in support of Chavez s socialist movement and to attend pro-government rallies.  Del Pino, by contrast, eased up on revolutionary garb and attendance at militant gatherings. He also sought closer relationships with foreign partners frustrated by currency controls and a lack of professionalism at PDVSA.  Still, many PDVSA insiders and oil executives were ultimately disappointed with Del Pino s management. Instead of improvements, he presided over a major production fall that brought Venezuela s oil output to near 30 year-lows.  Del Pino ultimately found his hands tied at a company where intervention by the government is common. Last January, Maduro replaced many of his top executives with political and military appointees. Whether Del Pino and other arrested executives are ultimately found guilty or not, many in Venezuela see opportunism behind the ongoing purge, not a concerted effort to stamp out graft. The industry, after all, has been under tight control of the ruling Socialist Party since shortly after Chavez came to power in 1998. Although the government ridiculed a report last year by the opposition-run Congress, finding that some $11 billion went missing at PDVSA over a decade, it now recognizes that many voters support the anti-corruption stances espoused by rivals.  The opposition has been pushing for a fight against corruption, and now Maduro wants to appropriate that,  said Alvarado, the opposition lawmaker. After surviving major protests this year and pushing through a controversial pro-government legislative superbody, Maduro is feeling empowered, government officials said. He seeks to fortify his position for re-election next year. He is also expected to continue finding ways to target perceived threats to his political power. Some in Venezuela see Del Pino s arrest as a way of getting at an old rival: Ramirez, the former PDVSA boss.  Ramirez, until recently Venezuela s envoy to the United Nations, is believed by many in the government to have presidential ambitions.  Although Ramirez has not been mentioned by prosecutors, senior government officials increasingly refer to his time at PDVSA as a period when  mafias  were formed and executives like Del Pino grew ascendant.  This week, after Ramirez criticized the president in recent opinion articles online, Maduro fired him and summoned him back to Caracas, according to people familiar with the clash. Late Friday, police arrested Diego Salazar, a relative of Ramirez, in what prosecutors said was another corruption investigation. Ramirez did not respond to a request for information on Friday.  ",

         "Does this mean Republicans in the House are FINALLY going to start standing up for the Americans who elected them to be their representatives in Washington DC? Does this action represent the change we re all desperate to see now that Boehner is vacating his seat? House Republicans on Tuesday introduced a resolution to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, accusing him of making  false statements  under oath and failing to comply with a subpoena for evidence.In case you ve forgotten, here are two of the most powerful testimonies exposing the tyranny of our government  we have ever posted on our website:Our friend Becky Gerritson (who is currently running for a seat in our US Congress):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE4_MT8MkIAAnd then there was the powerful testimony by Founder and Chairman of True the Vote, Catherine Engelbrecht:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db21AQu30XwHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and 18 other committee members introduced the resolution to begin impeachment proceedings. In doing so, they followed through on a threat first made over the summer, when Republicans accused the IRS leader of making inaccurate statements to Congress regarding the Tea Party targeting scandal and its aftermath. Commissioner Koskinen violated the public trust,  Chaffetz said in a statement Tuesday.  He failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled. Impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the IRS and to protect the institutional interests of Congress. The IRS issued a statement later Thursday saying,  The IRS vigorously disputes the allegations in the resolution. We have fully cooperated with all of the investigations. The announcement of the impeachment resolution comes on the same day Koskinen testified before the Senate Finance Committee, and after the Justice Department on Friday decided to close its investigation of the targeting scandal without pursuing criminal charges.

         "Republican senators urge Trump to embrace findings on Russia hacking",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senior Republican senators urged President-elect Donald Trump to punish Russia in response to U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that President Vladimir Putin personally directed efforts aimed at influencing the outcome of the November election.  In a joint appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain said evidence was conclusive that Putin sought to influence the election - a point that Trump has refuted repeatedly by arguing it might be impossible to tell who was responsible.  “In a couple weeks, Donald Trump will be the defender of the free world and democracy,” Graham said. “You should let everybody know in America, Republicans and Democrats, that you’re going to make Russia pay a price for trying to interfere.” Both senators said they remain unsure if they will support Trump’s pick for secretary of state, former Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson, who has been criticized for his close ties to Putin. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on Wednesday to consider Tillerson’s nomination.  Three U.S. intelligence agencies released a joint report on Friday that concluded that Putin directed efforts to help Trump’s electoral chances by discrediting his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.   Hackers penetrated the Democratic National Committee’s email server and separately stole emails from John Podesta, who chaired Clinton’s campaign. The emails were then posted online and used to embarrass Clinton, including by Trump who frequently used the content as political ammunition.  Russia was trying to undermine public faith in the democratic process, damage Clinton, making it harder for her to win and harm her presidency if she did, the unclassified report said. McCain said he supports continued investigations into the hacks.  “We need to come to grips with it and get to the bottom of it and overall come up with a strategy in this new form of warfare that can basically harm our economy, harm our elections, harm our national security,” he said.  Trump, whose views on Russia are out of step with his party, has repeatedly dismissed claims that the Russians were trying to help him, arguing that the charges against Russia are the product of his political opponents trying to undermine his victory.  On Friday, after receiving his intelligence briefing, Trump did not squarely address whether he was told of the agencies’ belief Russia carried out the hacking. Instead, he said: “Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations” including the DNC.  On Saturday, Trump wrote on Twitter that having a better relationship with Russia is a “good thing.” “Only ‘stupid’ people or fools, would think that is bad!” he tweeted. “We have enough problems around the world without yet another one. When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!”  ",

         "LOUISVILLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A man has been arrested for assaulting U.S. Senator Rand Paul  at his Kentucky home on Friday and causing a “minor injury,” the state police said. Rene Boucher, 59, of Bowling Green, Kentucky, was arrested and charged with one count of fourth-degree assault causing minor injury, the Kentucky State Police said in a statement on Saturday. Paul and Boucher were acquaintances, said Jeremy Hodges, a state police spokesman, who declined to say what led to the incident.  Paul’s office said in a statement the former Republican presidential candidate “was blindsided and the victim of an assault. The assailant was arrested, and it is now a matter for the police. Senator Paul is fine.” His office did not immediately respond to questions about the extent of any injuries the 54-year-old senator may have suffered or the circumstances of the incident. Hodges said Paul’s injuries were minor and did not require transport to a hospital. Boucher was booked into the Warren County Regional Jail. He was released on Saturday after posting a $7,500 bond, Captain Chip Olney of the facility said by phone. Boucher is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, Olney said. It was unclear if Boucher has an attorney, and he could not be reached for comment late on Saturday. Paul, an ophthalmologist, dropped out of the race for president in February 2016 and successfully ran for re-election as a senator. In September, Paul opposed a partial repeal of healthcare reforms adopted under former Democratic President Barack Obama, angering President Donald Trump, a Republican. Paul last month played golf with Trump and discussed tax reform proposals. ",

         "Court document shows Manafort wealth, ties to Russian oligarchs",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, had three U.S. passports, millions in assets and ties to Russian oligarchs, according to federal court documents after his indictment on tax fraud and money laundering charges. Manafort and associate Rick Gates pose a significant flight risk because of the serious nature of the charges, the strong evidence of guilt, their wealth and “their history of deceptive and misleading conduct,” federal prosecutors said in a filing Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Manafort, 68, and Gates, who also worked on Trump’s campaign, pleaded not guilty on Monday in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. The charges came as part of federal special counsel Robert Mueller’s 5-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favor and potential collusion by campaign aides. The allegations are not related to campaign activities but reveal close ties to Russia, and include activities from 2006 to 2017, which overlaps with the mens’ work on Trump’s campaign. The two men are under house arrest and have relinquished their U.S. passports, with a $10 million bond set for Manafort and a $5 million bond for Gates. “Both defendants have substantial ties abroad, including in Ukraine, where both have spent time and have served as agents of its government,” according to the government’s memorandum in support of the conditions of release.  “And both Manafort and Gates have connections to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs, who have provided millions of dollars to Manafort and Gates.”  The next hearing in the case, set for 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Thursday, will concern the bail conditions that were set at Monday’s arraignment. Manafort was a longtime U.S. Republican operative before turning his attention to political consulting overseas. He submitted 10 passport application in the last decade and currently holds three U.S. passports, the memo said. It is rare but legal to hold three valid passports. People can apply for more than one passport under limited circumstances, including when a foreign country will deny entry to someone holding a passport showing travel to certain other countries or when a visa request is being processed but a  person needs a valid passport for immediate travel, a State Department official said on Wednesday. The official could not comment on Manafort’s passport records but said requests for more than one valid passport are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Asked about the information in the memo, Manafort lawyer Jason Maloni told Reuters on Wednesday his client “looks forward to having these allegations tried before a judge and jury.” The memo said Manafort’s financial assets were substantial but difficult to quantify because he listed figures on loan applications and other financial documents since 2012 that ranged from $19 million to $136 million. Manafort and Gates owned or controlled entities and accounts worldwide including in Cyprus, Grenadines, Seychelles and England, it said.      Manafort traveled to Mexico, China and Ecuador in 2017, prosecutors said. ",

         "Obama, EU leaders agree to stick together, stay tough on Russia",
         "BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama and European leaders on Friday underscored the importance of working together in NATO and chided Russia for its bombing of Syria and failure to implement a Ukrainian peace accord. The White House statement followed a meeting at which Obama sought to reassure his counterparts from Germany, Britain, Spain, Italy and France that his successor Donald Trump would not break up the transatlantic alliance. Trump raised concerns during the campaign when he said he could withhold military aid from NATO allies if they had not met their defense commitments and said he would forge closer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “President Obama expressed confidence that, even at a moment of great change, democratic values have done more to advance human freedom and progress than any other system in history, and will continue to do so going forward,” the White House said. The leaders agreed on the need to work together to stabilize the Middle East and North Africa, as well as securing diplomatic resolutions for the conflicts in Syria and eastern Ukraine. European leaders had sought Obama’s support as they prepare to extend sanctions imposed on Russia by Washington and Brussels in 2014 following its intervention in eastern Ukraine, and consider fresh sanctions over Russia’s actions in Syria, where it backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy that no decisions had been made about extending the Ukraine sanctions, but actions to implement the Minsk peace accord were not sufficient. Merkel said the leaders discussed their concerns about Syria during their meeting on Friday, but did not talk about imposing Syria-related sanctions against Russia that have been sought by the Syrian opposition. Obama and the EU leaders called for an immediate end to attacks on rebel-held parts of the city of Aleppo by Syrian government forces and their allies Russia and Iran that monitoring groups say have killed dozens this week alone. Syrian opposition officials on Friday met EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and other officials and urged them to focus on protecting civilians and lifting the siege, said Anas al-Abdah, who heads the Syrian National Coalition. He said he had hoped for stronger words from Obama and the EU leaders, and called for Washington and Brussels to put more “real pressure” on Russia and Iran. U.S. and EU officials have stressed the need for a political solution, including the departure of Assad, but Trump has said he views the fight against Islamic State as a bigger priority. EU leaders are expected to extend sanctions related to Ukraine in December or January. Obama and the European leaders “unanimously agreed on the continued need for Russia to fully meet its commitments under the Minsk agreements and that Ukraine-related sanctions against Russia must remain in place until it does so,” the White House said. They said a durable ceasefire in eastern Ukraine was needed to move forward with free and fair local elections in the occupied regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.     ",

         "OBAMA FIGHTS TO KEEP RADICAL AGENDA ALIVE: Asks Crooked AG Loretta Lynch To Find Way To Challenge Supreme Court Decision That Blocked His Executive Order Amnesty Scheme",
         "This is a good reminder of how important it is to prevent Obama from anointing another radical on the Supreme Court. It might also be a good time for every American to call their representatives in Washington. Keeping another radical Obama appointee off our Supreme Court could literally be the only thing standing between a free America and one that looks more like Venezuela. This is also a reminder for anyone in the Republican party who considers themselves part of the  never Trump  movement. The Democrat party has never been more serious about, or closer to, fundamentally changing America forever The Obama administration is looking into whether it can challenge the Supreme Court s decision to block President Barack Obama s plan to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Tuesday. We will be reviewing the case and seeing what, if anything else, we need to do in court,  Lynch told Reuters in an interview.Lynch did not say what legal options the Obama administration may pursue following a split decision by the Supreme Court justices last week that left in place a block on the executive action by a lower court.She said any future executive actions Obama may take on immigration would be left to the White House.In a wideranging interview on topics from gun control to the effect of the planned exit of Britain from the European Union, Lynch identified espionage from foreign nationals on U.S. companies as a  tremendous problem. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported a 53 percent increase in cases of economic espionage between 2014 and 2015 and the majority of cases involve Chinese nationals as culprits.Most recently, Xu Jiaqiang, 30, was charged with economic espionage and theft of trade secrets, for stealing software source code from his U.S. employer with the intent of benefiting the Chinese government. It is a matter of priority for us,  Lynch said.  When companies or industries are preyed upon by others, be they individuals, be they state actors who literally steal the fruit of their intellectual labors, essentially they are stealing from future generations also.

         "REPORT: PRESIDENT TRUMP Is “Odds-On Favorite To Win Re-election” In 2020",
         "Liberal heads explode in 5 4 3 2 1President Trump could win the White House again in 2020   which likely would send hostile political operatives and the disapproving news media into an epic meltdown. News flash: Get ready. Mr. Trump will likely win re-election, says one analyst.  President Trump did not ascend to the White House in the usual way; he broke with traditional campaign orthodoxy and tactics,  Ford O Connell, a political analyst and adjunct professor at the George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management, tells Inside the Beltway. While Trump s first six months in the White House have been marked by early stumbles, a healthy dose of palace intrigue and low approval numbers, history says Trump is in fact the odds-on favorite to win re-election in 2020, should he choose to run. Why? Because presidential incumbency has its privileges. Since 1900, 20 presidents have sought re-election. Of those, 15 won and five lost   that is, if you include Gerald Ford, who was never elected in the first place. Adds Mr. O Connell,  So how does President Trump avoid becoming the sixth president to be fired by the people in the last 120 years? Barring some unforeseen calamity or Dwayne  The Rock  Johnson becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, the fate of Trump s presidency will live and die with the state of the economy in the fall of 2020. To ensure that the electoral winds are favorable to Trump, his administration must deliver results by passing tax reform before the 2018 midterms, showing significant progress on other key campaign promises: securing America s borders, infrastructure, trade, conservative judicial appointees. He must also continue to instill in working-class voters in both the Rust Belt (Ohio, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin) and Sun Belt (Florida, North Carolina, Arizona) battleground states the belief that he is tirelessly fighting for them. If Trump does that, voters will forgive his impetuous ways and rehire him,  the professor concludes.For entire story: Washington Times ",

         "GAY MARRIAGE APPROVED BY SUPREME COURT With Ironic Dissenting Opinion From Justice Roberts: “But this court is not a legislature”",
         "The  Fundamental Transformation  of America is almost complete. Even Barack Hussein Obama must be surprised by how few hurdles have been placed in his way In less than 24 hours, our leftist US Supreme Court delivered not one, but two sucker punches to the heart of America. The acts of these radical judicial activists will have a dramatic effect on our society and culture in the United States of America.    The Supreme Court declared Friday that same-sex couples have a right to marry anywhere in the United States.Gay and lesbian couples already could marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The court s 5-4 ruling means the remaining 14 states, in the South and Midwest, will have to stop enforcing their bans on same-sex marriage.The outcome is the culmination of two decades of Supreme Court litigation over marriage, and gay rights generally. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, just as he did in the court s previous three major gay rights cases dating back to 1996. It came on the anniversary of two of those earlier decisions. No union is more profound than marriage,  Kennedy wrote, joined by the court s four more liberal justices.The four dissenting justices each filed a separate opinion explaining their views. But this court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us,  Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in dissent. Roberts read a summary of his dissent from the bench, the first time he has done so in nearly 10 years as chief justice.Justice Antonin Scalia said he is not concerned so much about same-sex marriage, but about  this court s threat to American democracy.  Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas also dissented.The ruling will not take effect immediately because the court gives the losing side roughly three weeks to ask for reconsideration. But some state officials and county clerks might decide there is little risk in issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.The cases before the court involved laws from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Those states have not allowed same-sex couples to marry within their borders and they also have refused to recognize valid marriages from elsewhere.Just two years ago, the Supreme Court struck down part of the federal anti-gay marriage law that denied a range of government benefits to legally married same-sex couples.The decision in United States v. Windsor did not address the validity of state marriage bans, but courts across the country, with few exceptions, said its logic compelled them to invalidate state laws that prohibited gay and lesbian couples from marrying.The number of states allowing same-sex marriage has grown rapidly. As recently as October, just over one-third of the states permitted same-sex marriage.There are an estimated 390,000 married same-sex couples in the United States, according to UCLA s Williams Institute, which tracks the demographics of gay and lesbian Americans. Another 70,000 couples living in states that do not currently permit them to wed would get married in the next three years, the institute says. Roughly 1 million same-sex couples, married and unmarried, live together in the United States, the institute says.Via: AP News ",

         "It s a shame Megyn Kelly believed she had launch an attack at then candidate Trump during his first debate in order to score points with the  feminist  crowd. She was the smart darling of conservatives until she crossed FOX News viewers with her embarrassing and relentless attacks on Donald Trump during his campaign. There aren t too many conservatives who really care where she ends up, and there aren t likely too many liberals who are going to willingly embrace her either Megyn Kelly is still under what is being described as a messy contract with Fox News.While the cable news network is saying that Mrs. Kelly is free to do whatever she wants professionally, her official spokesperson is singing another tune.This week, the Wall Street Journal, confirmed that despite the fact that Mrs. Kelly has signed with NBC in early January 2017, she is still tied to the right-learning network.After a decade with the Fox News Channel, the former corporate defense attorney exited after declining a 20 million dollar contract.The journalist and political commentator will be earning between $15 to $18 million on the Peacock Network and for her  triple role. According to top executives, Kelly will host her daytime program and in-depth Sunday night news show. She will appear on the network s political and major news event coverage.The shows will start in the fall, but Kelly has not been taking part in hiring her team.Moreover, there are no titles for her programs as yet, and NBC still has not been decided at what time she will go on.Kelly s spokeswoman, Leslee Dart, said she can not take these important decisions because  the terms of the termination are still being negotiated. Last week, AOL published a fascinating piece where they confirmed that Kelly is no friend of  TODAY  co-anchor Matt Lauer. It was revealed that NBC is looking for an executive producer to lead Kelly s show.And one thing is sure,  Megyn doesn t want a Lauer loyalist running her show. She wants a team she can trust, and that will have her back.  Celebrity InsiderMatt Lauer doesn t appear to have the star power required to keep viewers interested without a strong female side-kick, as it was announced by the New York Post a couple of weeks ago that a,  Panicked  NBC asked Savannah Guthrie to come back early . Savannah Guthrie cut her maternity leave short by four days, and sources say it s because brass at  Today  were stressing over ratings. The show was in a free fall. She initially announced that she d be returning on March 3, but they were in a panic . . . and called her back early,  an industry insider told Page Six.Guthrie surprised Matt Lauer on-air last week, days after Lester Holt and Bryant Gumbel filled in as co-hosts. Their bro-show didn t work. They needed Savannah to bail them out, so they rushed her from maternity leave. NBC claimed it was because of the influx of news, but the reality is that the show was down double-digits and they needed her,  the source said. ",

         "Adviser rules out Trump meeting North Korea's Kim in near future",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An adviser to Donald Trump said on Tuesday he could not foresee any circumstances in the short or medium term in which the Republican presidential nominee would meet the leader of North Korea if he became president. The remark appeared to take a step back from Trump’s position in May, when he told Reuters he was willing to talk to Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang’s nuclear program. Peter Hoekstra, a former Republican congressman and now an adviser to Trump, was asked at a debate on U.S. policy towards North Korea under what conditions Trump would meet Kim. “I can’t imagine any set of circumstances, in the short or intermediate future, that would see President Trump in a summit meeting with the leader of North Korea,” he said. Hoekstra avoided directly repeating suggestions by Trump that U.S. allies Japan and South Korea could be allowed to develop nuclear weapons to defend themselves against North Korea, rather than relying on the U.S. nuclear umbrella. “That will be decided once South Korea, Japan the United States identify what their objectives are going to be vis-à-vis North Korea and the tactics they are going to put in place to address that objective,” he said, when asked to clarify where Trump stood on the issue. However, Hoekstra added that it would be “stated very, very clearly, as we go into those discussions with South Korea and Japan, that everything’s on the table.” Former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Kurt Campbell, a supporter of Trump’s rival Hillary Clinton, said: “The real issue here is, ‘Is this strategically wise?’” According to Campbell, Trump had said “maybe in the heat of the campaign ... things that have been deeply unnerving to Asia.” Hoekstra said Trump was not seeking to challenge U.S. friendships in Asia, but it was necessary to sit down with allies to develop a successful North Korea strategy. Asked about Trump’s complaints that Asian allies were freeloading on the United States, he said Trump’s business background meant some of his statements came out “a little bit more coarse than some of us in the political world might be comfortable with.” But allies would be expected to pay their “fair share” as U.S. taxpayers could not subsidize the defense of others, he said. Asked if their candidates considered preemptive strikes a conceivable means of dealing with North Korea’s nuclear program, both Campbell and Hoekstra said no options were off the table. ",

         "British PM May forces her deputy to resign over pornography scandal",
         "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May forced her most senior minister, Damian Green, to resign for lying about whether he knew pornography had been found on computers in his parliamentary office. The resignation of one of May s closest political allies, who had helped pacify her deeply divided party, is a blow as she navigates the final year of tortuous negotiations ahead of Britain s exit from the European Union in March 2019. Green, who voted to stay in the EU, was appointed as first secretary of state just six months ago in a bid to shore up May s premiership following her disastrous bet on a June snap election that lost her party its majority in parliament. But Green s future was thrust into doubt when the Sunday Times newspaper reported last month that police in 2008 had found pornography on his office computers in the Houses of Parliament. In response, Green said the story was untrue. A review, requested by May and conducted by a senior government official, concluded that Green s statements which suggested he was not aware that indecent material had been found  on the computers, were  inaccurate and misleading.  The inquiry, a summary of which was distributed by May s Downing Street office, found he had breached rules governing the behavior of ministers because the police had told him about the indecent material.  I apologize that my statements were misleading on this point,  Green said in a letter to May.  I regret that I ve been asked to resign from the government.  Green, 61, said he did not download or view pornography on his parliamentary computers. He added that he should have been clearer about his statements after the story broke.  May said she had asked him to resign and accepted his resignation with deep regret. He is the most senior British politician to fall since the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal triggered a debate about a culture of abuse by some powerful men at the heart of Westminster. May s defense minister, Michael Fallon, quit last month for unspecified conduct which he said had fallen below required standards. Her aid minister resigned a week later after holding undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials. During the turmoil that followed the botched election, May turned to Green   a university friend from their days at Oxford   to stabilize her premiership and appease those within the Conservative Party who wanted her to quit. One of his key roles was to act as a conduit for disgruntled party members who felt they had been ignored in May s election campaign. He sought to help her to shed the image of a distant leader who only listens to those in her inner circle.  It s another blow for May but it is not deadly in any way at all,  said Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King s College London.  She has lost her soulmate in cabinet but this is not the end of Prime Minister May.    May is surviving not because of Damian Green but because there are sufficient MPs in her party who don t want to have a leadership election while Brexit is going on and that fundamental calculation has not changed,  he said. The internal investigation found that Green s conduct as a minister was generally  professional and proper  but found two statements he made on Nov. 4 and 11 to be inaccurate and misleading.  In the statements, Green suggested he was not aware that indecent material had been found on his computers. The inquiry said Green s statements had fallen short of the honesty requirements for those in public life and thus constituted breaches of the ministerial code of conduct. The allegations about pornography were publicly aired by former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick, drawing a rebuke from the head of the London police, Cressida Dick, who said officers had a duty of confidentiality. May, who served as home secretary for six years before winning the top job, said she shared concerns about the comments made by the former police officer. Sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Weinstein have prompted some women and men to share stories about improper behavior at the heart of British political power in Westminster. The internal investigation also addressed allegations, made by the daughter of a family friend, that Green had made an unwanted advance towards her during a social meeting in 2015, had suggested that this might further her career, and later had sent her an inappropriate text message. The report said it was not possible to reach a definitive conclusion on the appropriateness of Green s behavior in that instance, though the investigation found allegations to be plausible. Green said in his resignation letter that he did not recognize the account of events, but apologized to the woman, academic and critic Kate Maltby, for making her feel uncomfortable. ",

         "Trump nominee to lead FDA questioned on ties to pharmacy industry",
         "(Reuters) - Democratic senators questioned President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, over his ties to the pharmaceutical industry on Wednesday, with one citing “a level of discomfort” over his nomination. Democrats on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions questioned whether Gottlieb’s ties to the pharmaceutical industry would compromise his ability to act impartially, ahead of a vote on whether to advance his nomination to the full Senate. Gottlieb, a former FDA deputy commission who is a partner at a large venture capital fund and sits on the boards of multiple healthcare companies, has advocated loosening requirements needed for approval of new medical products. His nomination is generally expected to be approved. The hearing also covered Gottlieb’s views on issues ranging from clinical trials to the opioid epidemic and vaccines. Senator Chris Murphy said Democrats had “a level of discomfort” with Gottlieb’s nomination, not just because of his private industry background but also because of his prior activity as a political adviser to Republican presidential candidates and opposition to the Affordable Care Act. “The worry about impartiality is certainly connected to the private sector experience but it’s also to your very deep political involvement as well,” Murphy said. Gottlieb, 44, acknowledged the concern, but said he would “work hard to make sure I preserve my impartiality.” In an ethics disclosure form filed last month Gottlieb said he would resign from multiple corporate boards and divest his healthcare company holdings. Republicans on the committee said Gottlieb’s background would provide him with valuable insight into the industry that the FDA regulates. Gottlieb said his goal was to implement the provisions in the recently passed 21st Century Cures Act that among other things require the FDA to consider ways to streamline the clinical trial process. He said he would be in favor of “clinical trial constructs that don’t require the tight randomization that current clinical trials do.” Gottlieb also said he would be willing to challenge the view that vaccines cause autism, a theory that has been widely debunked by vaccine experts. In January Trump’s transition team floated the idea of forming a panel on autism. In 2014 Trump said in a tweet that he believed in vaccinations “but not massive, all at once, shots” and that “Govt. Should stop NOW!” Gottlieb said the question of whether vaccines cause autism “is one of the most exhaustively studied issues in medicine” and that there is no causal link between vaccines and autism. Pressed on whether he would challenge contrary views, Gottlieb said he has a history “of not being shy about speaking truth to power and making my views known.” Gottlieb called the opioid epidemic “a public health emergency on the order of Ebola and Zika.” He said it is the biggest health crisis facing the FDA and that solving the problem would require a broad public health response. Gottlieb, who held a financial interest in the vape shop Kure, said some e-cigarettes may have the potential to wean smokers off combustible cigarettes and be less harmful. “An e-cigarette or vaping product might be a good smoking cessation tool while a chocolate chip-flavored e-cigarette might not be,” he said. Ultimately, he said, science will tell where to draw that line. ",

         "Gerry Adams to step down in end of an era for Irish nationalism",
         "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Sinn Fein s Gerry Adams, a pivotal figure in the political life of Ireland for almost 50 years, said on Saturday he will step down as party leader and complete a generational shift in the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Reviled by many as the face of the IRA during its campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland, Adams reinvented himself as a peacemaker in the troubled region and then as a populist opposition parliamentarian in the Irish Republic. Adams said he would be replaced as party president, a position he has held since 1983, at a party conference next year. He would also not stand for reelection to the Irish parliament.  Republicanism has never been stronger... But leadership means knowing when it is time for change. That time is now,  Adams said in an emotional speech to a packed party conference.  I have complete confidence in the next generation of leaders,  he said.  Adams stayed on stage as the 2,500-strong crowd, some in tears, gave him a standing ovation and sang a traditional Irish song about the road home, followed by the national anthem.  Adams will almost certainly hand over to a successor with no direct involvement in the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland, a prospect that would make Sinn Fein a more palatable coalition partner in the Irish Republic where it has never been in power. Deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald, an English literature graduate from Trinity College Dublin who has been at the forefront of a new breed of Sinn Fein politicians transforming the party s image, is the clear favourite to take over. That would mean the left-wing party being led on both sides of the Irish border by women in their 40s after Michelle O Neill succeeded Martin McGuinness as leader in Northern Ireland shortly before the former IRA commander s death in March. Adams, who will turn 70 next October, has always denied membership of the IRA but accusations from former IRA fighters that he was involved in its campaign of killings have dogged him throughout his career.  Adams was a key figure in the nationalist movement throughout the three decades of violence between Catholic militants seeking a united Ireland, mainly Protestant militants who wanted to maintain Northern Ireland s position as a part of Britain, and the British army.  3,600 died in the conflict, many at the hands of the IRA. As head of the political wing of the IRA during its bombing campaigns in 1980s Britain, Adams was a pariah and banned from speaking on British airwaves, forcing television stations to dub his voice with that of an actor. He and his party emerged from the political cold in October 1997 when he shook hands with Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair at their first meeting. A year later, he helped win sceptical elements in the IRA to the Good Friday peace deal, which largely ended the violence. Since the peace deal Adams and McGuinness turned Sinn Fein from a fringe party into the dominant Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland and the third largest party in south of the border. While its anti-austerity platform led to a six-fold increase in its number of seats in the Republic - 23 out of 158 -  suspicion of Sinn Fein s role in the Northern Ireland troubles still runs deep and the far larger ruling Fine Gael and or main opposition Fianna Fail have ruled out governing alongside them. Analysts say a change of leader could help open the way to Sinn Fein entering government in Dublin for the first time.   Under a new Sinn Fein leader I think anything is possible,  said David Farrell, politics professor at University College Dublin.  A new Sinn Fein leader will also take over responsibility for rescuing power-sharing devolved government in Northern Ireland and avoid a return to full direct rule from London for the first time in decade.  Power-sharing collapsed after Sinn Fein withdrew in January saying the Democratic Unionist Party was not treating it as an equal partner and a series of talks have failed to break the impasse. ",

As everyone knows, it is a direct violation of FEC laws for super PACS to coordinate with campaigns for any reason. Yet, that doesn t appear to have prevented Carly or her super PAC from trying to work around that law.Up until this point, candidates have tried various measures to exploit loopholes in the law, the most popular one being waiting to announce their presidential runs formally in order to finance their campaigns early on. Carly has done this and taken it to the extreme. Her super PAC now handles all the functions at her campaign stops that a campaign normally would. It s practically unheard of. This by itself isn t a violation, though. The New York Times even said Carly s campaign s strategy of posting her schedule online to alert her super PAC of where she ll be giving speeches so that her super PAC can show up and set up shop, has been a brilliant a run around of the law. That way, they can claim they haven t  coordinated.  They can just show up and claim to be independent.New email evidence shows this not to be true. In fact, if anything, Carly s super PAC has even helped organize the events. The International Business Times reviewed a handful of emails between employees at Winthrop University in South Carolina (where Carly had a September event), staff for the Fiorina campaign, and Carly for America. They found that when an employee had trouble getting in touch with Fiorina about correcting details on an Eventbrite website for the event, that employee then decided to reach out directly to Taylor Manson, a super PAC employee, who coincidentally, was also listed as a person of contact on the Eventbrite page. The lines of campaign coordinating are being blurred more and more. I have a few questions about the location. What is the address of the building? Where should people park? Is there handicap parking available? Do y all plan on putting something out to your students to let them know she ll be there? It didn t take long for Manson to receive an advance walkthrough of the event location. While some might claim that it was the university that acted inappropriately, Larry Noble, a former FEC counsel who works for the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, says this is evidence that proves that the law has been broken. It s known as an  in-kind contribution,  and super PACs are prohibited from doing so. This fits the larger narrative that the super PAC is basically running the campaign s events. The whole thing frankly makes a mockery of the law. When the super PAC gets there, they hand out flyers, collect voter information, everything campaigns are known for. And   wealthy donors can finance all of it since they can make unlimited contributions to a super PAC but only a few thousand dollars directly to a candidate.That s not the only instance though that will plague Carly s campaign going forward. An event at George Tech last month also appears to be entirely organized by her super PAC, as well, according to emails provided to IBT by the University.Reps for Carly for America have repeatedly stated in the past that the group hasn t coordinated with Fiorina s campaign, but this new information shows otherwise. At the very least, a formal investigation needs to be launched to verify these new allegations. It should be interesting to watch how the Republican party responds to an email scandal that affects their own party, especially when campaign finance laws are being broken. Double standard, perhaps?Featured image via Facebook.",

         "MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government could use constitutional powers to suspend Catalonia s autonomy and prevent the region from splitting from Spain, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in an interview to newspaper El Pais published late on Saturday. Asked if he was ready to trigger the article 155 of the constitution, which enables him to sack the regional government and call a fresh local election, Rajoy answered:  I don t rule out absolutely anything that is within the law ... Ideally, it shouldn t be necessary to implement extreme solutions but for that not to happen things would have to be changed.  Rajoy also said he planned to leave in Catalonia the extra 4,000 police officers the government had shipped in to region for an independence vote on Oct. 1 until the crisis was over.  The conservative prime minister added he would not call a snap national election as a result of the political crisis and  ruled out using mediation to resolve it. ",

         " Trump Advisor’s Stupidity Makes CNN Host EXPLODE In Battle Over Climate Change (VIDEO)",
         "This morning, CNN host Chris Cuomo found himself trying to reason with a complete idiot when he had the unfortunate experience of having Donald Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci on his show New Day.The interview didn t take long to derail as Scaramucci continued to dispute climate change and the scientific community s  overwhelming consensus  that  man s actions have an impact on science. Scaramucci told Cuomo: Chris, there was an overwhelming science that the earth was flat. Cuomo was completely dumbfounded and said, It s called ignorance. You learn over time.  He continued: I just want you to understand, it s not ideological for me. I m just stating to you what the proposition is from the scientific community. Scaramucci replied, But it isn t for me either. Cuomo continued to be baffled by Scaramucci s stupidity and denial of facts. He fired back, But you don t accept the science. Scaramucci continued to argue with Cuomo and the rest of the scientific community. He said,  Thats not what I said. I said I m not certain about it. You can watch Cuomo try to talk some sense into the Trump advisor   with no success   below:Cuomo was pretty much talking to a wall during this exchange, and he might have been expecting too much from one of Trump s henchmen. After all, Trump s entire team has spent its campaign denying facts and spreading falsehoods.Meanwhile, NASA s website clearly states that climate change is a real, indisputable thing that has been measured and is happening. The site says: Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree. And this information has been documented and available for years. In 2006, The American Association for the Advancement of Science wrote,  The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society. But don t expect any of Trump s minions to do any research   not even a simple Google search. They re just like Trump   completely removed from reality.Featured image via screenshot",

         " It’s Already Happening: Potential Trump Pick Leaks Sensitive Information In Hilariously Stupid Way (IMAGE)",
         "Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach has reportedly been in the running for Secretary of Homeland Security, and as an early Trump supporter, he s got a pretty good chance of getting a position within the administration.On Sunday, he had a meeting with Trump that lends credence to that assumption. Eager for any political opportunity, he appeared in a photograph with overlord Trump, and in that photograph, papers concerning his plans for our homeland security can be clearly seen.And read.Here s the picture in question, taken by the Associated Press:In his haste to be photographed with the president-elect, he left sensitive information facing directly toward the camera. And as reported by the Topeka Capital-Journal, the paper is clearly legible in the original photograph.The document calls for updating and reintroducing the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System. The program was implemented in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, but largely suspended in 2011. All aliens from high-risk areas are tracked,  the document reads.The document then calls for  extreme vetting questions  for  high-risk aliens ; echoing Trump s campaign rhetoric. High-risk aliens would be questioned about support for Sharia law (Islamic religious law), jihad, the equality of men and women and the U.S. Constitution.The document also asks for reducing the intake of Syrian refugees to zero.In other words, Trump s current top pick for Homeland Security wants a registry, wants to violate religious freedoms through extreme vetting, is completely against actually helping anyone, and is too stupid to put the damn papers in the binder before posing for a picture.Also included in the document, but hidden partially by his arm so that context is unavailable: the Patriot Act, voter rolls, and possible amendments to the Voting Rights Act. Considering Trump s rhetoric and what the rest of the paper contains, that is terrifying. It looks as though Republicans want to use the Department of Homeland Security to suppress the Democratic vote.Kobach was the one who designed the previous registry system for immigrants as well   the one that was abandoned in 2011 because it was completely useless, and is also un-American in concept:Right off the bat, Kobach starts his list by detailing the way he will institute the Muslim registry. First, he wants to restart the highly ineffective and civil rights-violating Bush screening and tracking policy known as  NSEERS.  The program forced Muslim immigrants to register and then routinely check in with immigration officials while they were in the US or face jail or deportation. It was also a disaster. Obama scrapped the whole thing in his first term. (Source)It didn t even result in a single terrorist being prosecuted. In fact, none of these methods will work beyond appeasing the disgusting impulses of the xenophobic right wing now running our country. Alienating communities and painting enemies where there are none does nothing but help the people you re trying to fight. But in the case of fascists like Trump, creating an enemy is a good thing: It allows them to justify seizing greater power while they erode civil liberties. Mark my words   he will come for the press, for protesters, and even for voters. He doesn t believe in the same basic rights you and I do   he doesn t even understand them.In many ways, this incident is a fair representation of the Trump campaign (and pending administration) as a whole: Incompetent, inhuman, and deeply immoral.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",

         "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton posted an 11 percentage point lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, a small decline since late last week. The June 24-28 poll showed that 45.3 percent of likely American voters support Clinton while 34.1 percent support Trump, and another 20.5 percent support neither. Clinton’s lead was 14 points on Friday, though she has generally been widening her advantage over the New York real estate magnate since mid-May, when the two were nearly tied. The former secretary of state, senator and first lady was bolstered in recent days by endorsements from members of the Republican establishment, including Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary under former President George W. Bush. Her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, said last week he would vote for her to stop Trump even though his campaign said this was not a formal endorsement. Clinton is struggling to win over Sanders supporters after a hard-fought campaign for the nomination. Critics have assailed her over her handling of emails and a 2012 attack on a U.S. mission in Libya while secretary of state. Trump got a brief boost in the days after the June 12 mass shooting in Florida, coming within nine points of Clinton as he fine-tuned a campaign promise to temporarily ban the entry of Muslim immigrants to shore up national security. His level of support so far in June, however, lags behind what his predecessor, Republican White House hopeful Mitt Romney, received in the same period in 2012.  He has sparred with Republican leaders over his off-the-cuff rhetoric and lagged behind Clinton’s campaign organization in both size and fundraising, worrying some of his allies.  The poll included 1,099 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points. ",

BAMN is perhaps best known, however, for a 2016 incident in which they showed up to a rally held by the white-nationalist Traditionalist Workers Party outside the California state capitol building in Sacramento. The militant group was confrontational with the white-nationalists within minutes of arrival, and ten people were stabbed and hospitalized in a bloody fight. Police have verified through videos taken by members of the group, news organizations, and bystanders, that BAMN initiated the violence. Falarco was caught on camera at the event repeatedly punching a man in the stomach and throwing him to the ground.Arreguin, a far-left liberal, made headlines in February for his tweets prior to BAMN organizing a riot to prevent right-wing political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking at the city s University of California campus. Using speech to silence marginalized communities and promote bigotry is unacceptable. Hate speech isn t welcome in our community,  Arreguin had tweeted.The mayor also referred to Yiannopoulos as a  white supremacist,  and was forced to issue an  apology. I consider much of what Mr. Yiannopoulos says to be hateful. But I regret and apologize for the white national label,  Arreguin tweeted.Hours after his tweet, supporters of President Donald Trump who hoped to listen to Yiannopoulos speak were under a violent attack. People were assaulted with pipes, a generator-powered spotlight was firebombed, and looters destroyed several businesses in the area including a Starbucks.The rioters smashed windows, spray painted violent messages all over the area   including  Kill Trump    and began committing arsons. It was estimated that the rioters caused $100,000 in damage to the MLK Student Union, and $400,000 to $500,000 in damage to the area surrounding the university.It was immediately alleged that the mayor had ordered the police to stand down and allow the violence and destruction.Arreguin denied the accusations, saying that the police strategy was ordered by the department, not him.  They did an excellent job in preventing further risk to safety,  he added.It was alleged by journalist and author Mike Cernovich, who broke the Susan Rice scandal as well as impending Syria strikes, that the FBI was investigating Arreguin role in the stand down.Civil Rights section of FBI has opened an investigation into mayor @JesseArreguin, for inciting riots and ordering to police to stand down. pic.twitter.com/uy5EbgcvSm  Mike Cernovich   (@Cernovich) February 2, 2017Last weekend Antifa showed up to shut down the free speech of Trump supporters who were rallying in Berkeley, CA and were surprised by the number of pro-Trump patriots who weren t going to sit back and allow themselves to be beaten.Watch these two stunning interviews, where police officers almost admit to this liberal reporter that they ve been told to stand down:I tell a police officer I've been seeing people get beat up all day and they haven't been around. \"Okay, and?\" he says. pic.twitter.com/OuGEcvvb8R  Shane Bauer (@shane_bauer) April 15, 2017This police officer is clearly agitated that he s being asked why he s ignoring the violence:I ask a cop why they've been hanging back as a brawl is happening half a block away in Berkeley. \"I'm not at liberty to discuss my tactics.\" pic.twitter.com/teGEYBV1ho  Shane Bauer (@shane_bauer) April 15, 2017The last time violence erupted in Berkeley when anti-Trump terrorists attacked members of a pro-Trump rally, Americans were stunned to see police officers standing by and watching the violence unfold without making any attempt to stop it",

         " Trevor Noah Roasts Jeb Bush’s Pathetically Desperate Effort To Remain A Viable Candidate (VIDEO)",
         "If Jeb Bush watched The Daily Show last night, he should finally throw in the towel before he embarrasses himself and his family even more than he has already.On Monday night, Trevor Noah torched George W. Bush s brother in a hilarious segment that began with Noah referring to Jeb as the most desperate candidate in the presidential field. He s so desperate, he s even released his own fragrance for men,  Noah quipped. Dubbed  Desperation by Jeb!,  Noah promoted the scent as being  for when being yourself just isn t enough.  He then took a whiff and laughingly remarked,  Smells like George Bush. But it got even worse for Jeb from there.Noah reported that Bush and his supporters have spent more money on ads than anyone else, but that for all of the $40 million spent on positive ads telling voters about Bush, it has resulted in zero returns.This is a private admission from advisers to Jeb s own SuperPAC, Right To Rise. Even a Bush supporter was embarrassed by the results, exclaiming that,  You might as well light all of this money on fire. An amused Noah pointed out that it s pretty messed up when your campaign spending is failing so bad that burning the money would have been just as useful. That would have been more effective for Jeb Bush because at least people would have gathered around him for the warmth of the fire. People notice a fire. They don t notice Jeb Bush. The money could have been put to better use by building a new water system for Flint, Michigan, Noah added.Instead, Bush spent a lot of the money on video mailers featuring a Bush documentary that were actually mailed to his supporters and potential voters, something that Noah found to be such a huge waste of money that he was rendered speechless for a few seconds before regaining his composure to nail Jeb with another zinger. Poor Jeb, he s so desperate for his videos to go viral he s willing to physically mail them to your house. Still, Jeb Bush hadn t reached the bottom of the desperation pot.Noah then revealed that Bush had enlisted his mother to appear in an ad touting him as the one candidate who  seems  to be able to solve the country s problems. The Daily Show host noted that Jeb s own mom didn t sound sold on her son s qualifications as presidential material. It s like a guy getting his mom to hit people up on Tinder for him,  he said, which led to a video clip showing an exchange between Bush and a voter. Bush asked the voter who she is voting for. After she replied that she  didn t know yet,  Bush responded,  Oh, come on. And thus a new campaign slogan was born.Here s the video via Comedy Central.Seriously, Jeb. Do America a favor and put yourself out of our misery. It s probably the only thing you can do that people will support.Featured Image: Screenshot",

         "Karl Rove is suggesting Hillary suffered brain damage following her blood clot.On Sunday, Hillary Clinton s campaign manager would not commit to releasing her health records during the 2016 campaign.Face the Nation host John Dickerson pointed out that  Hillary Clinton had a big health scare when she was secretary of state  and asked campaign manager Robby Mook,  will she release her medial records as part of this campaign? I will let Hillary decide that,  Mook answered.  But I can tell you she has been hitting the campaign trail hard. In 2012, Clinton had to delay her Benghazi testimony to Congress after she fell and suffered a concussion. She later was treated for a blood clot in her brain, which experts said could have been  life threatening.  Though Clinton joked about her  cracked head  in emails that the State Department recently released, Bill Clinton revealed last year that Hillary s injuries  required six months of very serious work to get over. On the stump this weekend, Clinton tried to deflect concerns about her age by saying that she would be the  youngest woman president  if elected to the White House.Via:Breitbart News",

         " WATCH: Marco Rubio Says Trump Will ‘Have To Answer’ For Wiretapping Lies",
         "Donald Trump s list of allies is getting shorter because of his outrageous accusation against President Obama.During the campaign, Marco Rubio fiercely opposed Trump but soon chose to kiss his ass and endorse him.Rubio has been reluctant to say anything against Trump ever since, but that changed over the weekend after Trump openly accused President Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower in a Saturday morning Twitter rant.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Trump offered zero evidence to back up his claims and both former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and current FBI Director James Comey have forcefully refuted Trump s accusation.And now Rubio, who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, says that Trump will have to answer for his lies. I have no evidence and no one has presented anything to me that indicates anything like that,  Rubio told Meet The Press on Sunday.  Suffice it to say I don t have any basis, I ve never heard that allegation made before by anybody. I ve never seen anything about that anywhere before. But again, the president put that out there, and now the White House will have to answer as to exactly what he was referring to. Chuck Todd went on t ask Rubio if he would concede that if Trump is lying that it would be a huge political scandal and Rubio agreed.Here s the video via YouTube:Trump is desperate to distract everyone from focusing on his ever-growing Russia scandal, so he made up this lie based on a conspiracy theory he read on Breitbart in the hopes that Congress and the media will shift their focus.This is a serious accusation against a former president and Trump should be severely punished for it. He has offered no evidence to prove his claim and that means he is slandering President Obama, which should result in a lawsuit and impeachment. But we all know that Republicans in Congress have zero credibility so they will more than likely shield Trump and pursue a witch hunt against Obama, who was a more honorable and respected president than Trump will ever be.Featured image via screenshot",

         "Trump's investment funds lose money, billionaire unfazed",
         "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is built on his business acumen. But some of the Wall Street funds that he has invested in have proven less successful, underperforming industry benchmarks in the last 15 months, according to a Reuters examination. Eighteen out of 21 hedge funds and mutual funds in Trump’s portfolio lost money in 2015, and 17 of them are down so far this year, according to public disclosures and private performance data seen by Reuters. The funds managed by Paulson & Co, BlackRock Inc, Baron Capital and others lost an average of 8.5 percent last year, according to Reuters calculations, whereas stock market and hedge fund industry benchmarks broke even or came close to it. Trump’s funds are down another 2.9 percent so far this year, underperforming many benchmarks again. The performances in part reflect broader weaknesses in the investing climate. The last 15 months have been difficult for many portfolio managers amid volatile stock markets, tumbling oil and commodity prices, and an economic slowdown in China. Trump defended his holdings in an interview with Reuters, saying he invested in the funds three or four years ago and they have done well over time. “I put some money with people that are friends,” the New York businessman said by phone on Monday, without naming names. “I have no idea if they are up or down. I just know that they have been very good over a period of time,” added Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination for the November presidential election. Representatives for Baron, BlackRock and Paulson declined to comment. To be sure, some of Trump’s funds have performed well this year. For instance, Gabelli Funds’ GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources & Income fund, a closed-end vehicle, has gained 16.27 percent through March 22, beating a benchmark return of 15.89 percent for natural resource funds, according to net asset value data from Morningstar. Another fund that Trump has invested in, the Invesco European Growth Fund, gained 4.82 percent last year versus a benchmark loss of 5.66 percent, according to Morningstar. Gabelli and Invesco declined to comment. Both funds are listed as small holdings within Trump’s broader brokerage accounts.     The 21 funds examined by Reuters were among 23 funds that Trump disclosed last year in a July 15 filing with the Federal Election Commission. The performance of two of the funds could not be discerned. The Reuters review included performance data publicly disclosed by 14 mutual funds, as well as performance data on seven hedge funds seen in confidential fund reports or shared by people familiar with those firms. Trump told Reuters the funds are a tiny part of his investment portfolio. “I do very little hedge funds business. I for the most part don’t believe in it,” he said. The 23 funds were worth as much as $120.75 million, according to the FEC filing, a fraction of Trump’s self-proclaimed net worth of more than $10 billion.  While Trump selected the funds, their managers are responsible for choosing securities to invest in and the funds’ subsequent performance.  Some investing experts who looked at Trump’s portfolio and Reuters’ compilation of their performance were not impressed, saying he could have earned better returns by investing in other hedge funds.  For instance, Reuters previously reported that Millennium Management’s main Millennium International fund gained 12.65 percent in 2015, while Citadel gained 14.3 percent in its main multi-strategy hedge funds. “By the looks of it, Mr. Trump’s investing prowess is very pedestrian,” said Brian Shapiro, chief executive of Simplify LLC, which tracks and analyses alternative investments like hedge funds. “For someone who prides himself on being surrounded by the best talent,” added Brad Alford, an investment advisor and CEO of Alpha Capital Management, “I’m surprised to see so few winners.”  To be sure, some of Trump’s funds that fell in 2015 have fared better in previous years. For instance, BlackRock’s Obsidian fund has averaged annual returns of 3.39 percent over the last five years, according to a person familiar with the performance. Obsidian fell 6.17 percent in 2016 through March 11, while other comparable funds rose 0.69 percent, according to a private client report by HSBC’s Alternative Investment Group seen by Reuters. BlackRock declined to comment. “You can’t measure it in a short time. I’m way up with BlackRock. I’m way up with Obsidian,” Trump told Reuters, without elaborating further.  Trump disclosed a $27.6 million stake in Obsidian in May 2015, his largest fund holding. It is unclear when Trump first invested in Obsidian, which bets on corporate and government bonds, along with interest rates and other securities.  Obsidian was burned by a slide in oil and other commodities, according to a February BlackRock client note seen by Reuters. Trump’s stable of funds include two Angelo, Gordon & Co hedge funds, three Paulson & Co hedge funds, and 11 Baron Capital mutual funds. The mutual funds are open to virtually anyone, but hedge funds are only accessible to those that meet minimum wealth requirements, which typically include a net worth of more than $1 million. A representative for Angelo, Gordon & Co did not respond to a request for comment. Baron’s billionaire founder, Ron Baron, is known for long-term bets on companies and an optimistic world view. Trump uses 11 Baron vehicles with different investment strategies, including small-cap stocks, real estate and emerging markets. Nine of the funds lost money in 2015, with one energy and resources vehicle falling nearly 32 percent, according to data compiled by Morningstar. Nine are down this year through March 22 with single-digit losses.   Baron’s long-term track record is better. The firm’s best-known Baron Growth Fund has gained an average of about 8.6 percent annually over the last five years.  Paulson’s funds have produced a mixed performance in recent years. Led by New York billionaire John Paulson, the firm became famous for its prescient bet on the collapse of the subprime mortgage market leading up to the financial crisis.  But in 2015, the three Paulson funds used by Trump all fell, according to data provided by an investor to Reuters. One of the funds, the Paulson Advantage Plus fund, had declined an average of about 22 percent every year over the last five years, according to a confidential fund report seen by Reuters. Trump's filing to the FEC lists myriad business ventures, including holdings in hotels and golf properties, as well as individual stocks such as Apple Inc, Goldman Sachs and Altria Group. (Click here ) Trump told Reuters his stock picks have done well recently. “I bought them low and I sold them high,” he said, referring to a series of sales in January 2014 that netted more than $27 million.  “It was very good timing,” he added. “I hit the market exactly perfectly.” ",

         "THERE IS ONLY ONE THING CONSERVATIVES WANT TO HEAR THIS GUY SAY TODAY…",
         " I m leaving the GOP and running as a Democrat!Unfortunately, it doesn t look like that s what we re going to hear from our amnesty loving RINO (Republican In Name Only) friend.Reporting from Washington Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina defense hawk, plans to enter the crowded Republican presidential primary field Monday with a campaign that probably won t deliver him to the White House, but will highlight the party s divide over national security.Graham lacks the big-money backing and name recognition that s likely to be needed to pull away from the party s increasingly unwieldy field.But for him, that may not matter.For the last several years, Graham, a former Air Force colonel and legal officer, has played a central role in a sometimes-bitter battle between the GOP s traditional defense advocates and newly emergent isolationist-leaning libertarians led by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is also seeking the party s presidential nomination. The South Carolina senator did not originate the  wacko birds  label for Paul and his allies   that was coined by Graham s best friend in Congress, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)   but he might as well have.Last week Graham was caught on camera rolling his eyes as Paul objected to Senate efforts to continue the National Security Agency s once-secret collection of records of Americans  telephone calls.Paul returned the favor by releasing a video denouncing the NSA program. It ridiculed both Graham and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for their support of NSA surveillance, depicting Graham as trying to read Americans  emails while sitting in a 1997-era car.In an interview during the heat of the Senate debate, Paul also accused Graham, McCain and other Republicans who support arming insurgents in Syria of having contributed to the rise of Islamic State, also referred to as ISIS. ISIS exists and grew stronger because of the hawks in our party, who gave arms indiscriminately, and most of those arms were snatched up by ISIS,  he said.Graham said in an email to supporters that his  presidential announcement will be one of the biggest and most memorable moments of my life. As he approaches the military s mandatory retirement age and eyes the White House, Graham said last week he was retiring from the Air Force after nearly 30 years.

         "London s Muslim Mayor Sadiq Khan, called on the British government today to cancel their visit with President Donald Trump. Speaking to Channel 4 news, Khan felt Trump s out-of-context criticisms and continued attacks on Twitter meant that the U.K. should not  roll out the red carpet  for the president as  his policies go against everything we stand for. He added:  When you have a special relationship it is no different from when you have got a close mate. You stand with them in times of adversity but you call them out when they are wrong. There are many things about which Donald Trump is wrong.   Hollywood ReporterShouldn t London s government be more concerned with their current mayor s past than of President Trump s efforts to unify the world in the fight against extreme Islamic terrorism?In 2016, the now Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan was branded unfit to be London s Mayor after it emerged that he had described moderate Muslim groups as  Uncle Toms    a notorious racial slur used against black people to suggest that they are subservient to whites.The incendiary claim emerged in a 2009 interview with Iranian-backed Press TV, when Mr Khan was  minister for community cohesion , in charge of Government efforts to stamp out extremism.The revelation is a major blow for Mr Khan, who has faced a string of claims about his past dealings with Muslim extremists during the bitter campaign to succeed Boris Johnson.  Daily MailWatch the 2009 video here:That s not the only video that should make every London citizen be concerned about their Mayor s radical views. A 2002 video has emerged showing Sadiq Kahn defending convicted Islamic terrorists who attempted to revive the Islamic Liberation Party in Egypt.The video, via Josh Caplan of Vessel News, shows Khan defending terrorists.

         "Hezbollah says Saudi declares Lebanon war with Hariri detention",
         "BEIRUT/PARIS (Reuters) - Hezbollah s leader said on Friday that Saudi Arabia had declared war on Lebanon and his Iran-backed group, accusing Riyadh of detaining Saad al-Hariri and forcing him to resign as Lebanon s prime minister to destabilize the country. France became the first Western country to indicate that Saudi Arabia was holding Hariri against his will, saying it wished for him to have  all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in Lebanon . Hariri s resignation has plunged Lebanon into crisis, thrusting the small Arab country back to the forefront of regional rivalry between the Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi ite revolutionary Iran.     Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, said Saudi Arabia s detention of Hariri, a long-time Saudi ally who declared his resignation while in Riyadh last Saturday, was an insult to all Lebanese and he must return to Lebanon.      Let us say things as they are: the man is detained in Saudi Arabia and forbidden until this moment from returning to Lebanon,  Nasrallah said in a televised speech.  It is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon,  he said.     His comments mirror an accusation by Riyadh on Monday that Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the conservative Gulf Arab kingdom. Riyadh says Hariri is a free man and he decided to resign because Hezbollah was calling the shots in his government.  Saudi Arabia considers Hezbollah to be its enemy in conflicts across the Middle East, including Syria and Yemen.    Western countries have looked on with alarm at the rising regional tension. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned other countries and groups against using Lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the Middle East, saying Washington strongly backed Lebanon s independence and respected Hariri as a strong partner of the United States, still referring to him as prime minister.  There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state,  Tillerson said in a statement released by the U.S. State Department. Tillerson told reporters on Friday there was no indication that Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will but that the United States was monitoring the situation. The French foreign minister said earlier on Friday that he also believed Hariri was a free man - a statement at odds with the later French foreign ministry comment that it wanted Hariri to have  all his freedom of movement . Hariri has made no public remarks since announcing his resignation in a speech televised from Saudi Arabia, saying he feared assassination and accusing Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world. Two top Lebanese government officials, a senior politician close to Hariri and a fourth source told Reuters on Thursday that the Lebanese authorities believe Hariri is being held in Saudi Arabia.  Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was encouraging Israel to attack Lebanon. While an Israeli attack could not be ruled out entirely, he said, it was unlikely partly because Israel knew it would pay a very high price.  I warn them against any miscalculation or any step to exploit the situation,  he said.  Saudi will fail in Lebanon as it has failed on all fronts,  Nasrallah said. Riyadh has advised Saudi citizens not to travel to Lebanon, or if already there to leave as soon as possible. Other Gulf states have also issued travel warnings. Those steps have raised concern that Riyadh could take measures against the tiny Arab state, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees. Hariri s resignation is being widely seen as part of a Saudi attempt to counter Iran as its influence deepens in Syria and Iraq and as Riyadh and its allies battle Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen. Hariri s resignation unraveled a political deal among rival factions that made him prime minister and President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, head of state last year. The coalition government included Hezbollah, a heavily armed military and political organization. Aoun told Saudi Arabia s envoy on Friday that Hariri must return to Lebanon and the circumstances surrounding his resignation as prime minister while in Saudi Arabia were unacceptable, presidential sources said. An  international support group  of countries concerned about Lebanon, which includes the United States, Russia and France, appealed for Lebanon  to continue to be shielded from tensions in the region . In a statement, they also welcomed Aoun s call for Hariri to return.    In comments to Reuters, top Lebanese Druze politician Jumblatt said Lebanon did not deserve to be accused of declaring war on Saudi Arabia.  For decades we ve been friends,  he said.  We are a country that is squeezed between two antagonistic interests, between Saudi Arabia and Iran,  he said.  The majority of Lebanese are just paying the price ... Lebanon can not afford to declare a war against anybody.  The Saudi foreign minister accused Hezbollah of a role in the launching of a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday. Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iran s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen was an act of  direct military aggression  that could be an act of war. Nasrallah mocked the Saudi accusation that Iran and Hezbollah were behind the firing of the missile from Yemen, saying Yemenis were capable of building their own missiles.  ",

         "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - South Pacific island nations are scouring shipping records for vessels with links to North Korea after Fiji said it had identified 20 falsely flagged ships it suspects the isolated regime is using to evade United Nations sanctions. Fiji, along with Interpol and the Singapore-based regional shipping regulator Tokyo MoU, are investigating the vessels for links to North Korea, a spokesman for the country s Maritime Safety Authority (MSAF) told Reuters on Friday. Interpol and Tokyo MoU did not immediately respond to requests for comment on their investigations. The 18 members of the Pacific Islands Forum this month agreed to launch an audit of every ship registered in the Pacific to search for any links to North Korea. New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Gerry Brownlee said Pacific countries, including his own, were concerned North Korea was using falsely flagged cargo ships as one avenue to trade goods in spite of sanctions.  What we do know is that declared North Korean GDP (gross domestic product) is not big enough to support the nuclear program that they re running so there has to be significant black market or offbook revenue going into the country,  Brownlee told Reuters in a phone interview this week. The move came as the UN on Monday ramped up sanctions on North Korea, including tightening up oversight of vessels on the high seas. Authorities will now be allowed to check suspected vessels for prohibited cargo with the authority of the flag country.  UN sanctions introduced in August banned North Korean exports of seafood as part of efforts to curtail the regime s access to foreign funds. North Korea had been expected to earn an estimated $295 million from seafood in 2017, one U.N. diplomat said. In Fiji s case, the North Korean-linked ships had adopted the island nation s flag without formally registering, the MSAF said. It was not known in what way the possibly more-than 20 vessels were linked to North Korea or what their suspected activities or locations were. The MSAF declined to provide details due to the ongoing investigation. In addition to the fraudulent use of flags, Pacific governments were concerned North Korean vessels could be quietly registering in nations that allow international ships to use their flags.     If it s not clear why they re on that register, in other words, they re not regular callers into Pacific ports, then further investigation is needed to untangle the ship owner,  said Brownlee. The review would take place over the next couple of months, Brownlee said, and Australia and New Zealand would provide intelligence to help the small island nations check any North Korean connections.

         "ADEN, Yemen (Reuters) - Three suspected al Qaeda militants were killed in a drone strike in southern Yemen late on Thursday, a local security official and residents said. The strike in Mudiyah district in Abyan province on the Arabian Sea coast had targeted a motorcycle which the suspected militants were riding, the official said. Abyan is one of several provinces in central and southern Yemen where Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and its local affiliate Ansar al-Sharia operate. AQAP has taken advantage of a more than two-year civil war between the Iran-aligned Houthi group and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi s Saudi-backed government to strengthen its position in the impoverished country. The United States has repeatedly attacked AQAP with aircraft and unmanned drones in what U.S. officials say is a campaign to wear down the group s ability to coordinate attacks abroad. The Saudi-led coalition supporting Hadi has also launched thousands of air strikes against the Houthis which control Yemen s capital and much of the country s north. The Houthis have in turn fired rockets towards Saudi cities and villages. They say their attacks are in response to Saudi strikes on Yemeni cities and villages. The coalition spokesman said on Thursday that a Saudi pilot had died a day earlier when his plane crashed in the southern province of Abyan due to  technical failure , the Saudi news agency SPA said. The war has killed more than 10,000 people. ",

         "Chinese academics prod Beijing to consider North Korea contingencies",
         "BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese academics are publicly broaching the idea that China and the United States should share plans on how to deal with a  potential conflict on the Korean Peninsula, a sign some say of how North Korea s weapons test may be making Beijing more open to the once taboo subject. Chinese officials have rebuffed top U.S. military brass for years in their efforts to share contingencies for war or regime collapse in Pyongyang, suspicious over Washington s intentions and fearful that such engagement could further alienate North Korea, their once steadfast wartime ally. Jia Qingguo, the dean of the School of International Studies at China s elite Peking University and a respected advisor to Chinese leaders, said in an article this week that with the chances of war increasing daily, it might be time for China to  prepare for the worst .  When war becomes a real possibility, China must be prepared. And, with this in mind, China must be more willing to consider talks with concerned countries on contingency plans,  Jia wrote in an article first published on the online East Asia Forum run out of Australian National University. Given recent developments,  Beijing may have no better choice than to start talking with Washington and Seoul , Jia said. Ties between China and North Korea have deteriorated sharply in recent years, to the point some diplomats and experts fear Beijing may become, like Washington, a target of its neighbor s ire. Jia s comments, at the forefront of what is still a sensitive debate in China, were made before North Korea on Friday fired a missile that flew over Japan s northern Hokkaido far out into the Pacific Ocean.  That test came after the U.N. Security Council s latest round of sanctions on Monday banning North Korea s textile exports and capping fuel supplies in response to Pyongyang s accelerated effort to target the United States with a powerful, nuclear-tipped missile. Xie Tao, associate dean at the School of English and International Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said Chinese academics in years past would typically only express their opinions on whether China should be sharing plans with Washington behind closed doors.  Now you can get all sorts of people from the left and right and they are allowed to make their views public,  Xie told Reuters.  You could interpret that as a signal that the Chinese government is perhaps willing now to consider, if not actually join up to, contingency plans,  Xie said.  My sense is that there must be some in-depth discussion about what could potentially happen if there is a collapse or internal chaos   how Beijing and Washington should respond to this.  During a trip to China in August, Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended Chinese military drills at China s Northern Theater Command in the city of Shenyang, which covers China s border with North Korea.  Some analysts perceived that as China opening a crack in the door to its own preparations, but neither side are showing their cards to the public. Dunford said in Beijing during that visit that despite Washington s urgings the  conditions aren t set for such a detailed conversation  between the two militaries.  U.S. military officials have privately voiced frustration that previous channels established for direct military communications line are essentially unstaffed on the Chinese side. Dunford said creating a round-the-clock  responsive  communications link that could be used in a crisis was a top priority for military ties.

         "Peru's Congress ousts cabinet as political crisis deepens",
         "LIMA (Reuters) - Peru s opposition-controlled Congress ousted center-right President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski s cabinet in a vote of no-confidence early on Friday, pitching the copper-producing Andean country into its worst political crisis in years. In a gamble that will likely force him to scrap his plans to travel abroad later in the day, Kuczynski had dared Congress on Wednesday to revoke its confidence in his cabinet if it insisted on forcing out his second education minister. Under Peru s constitution, if Congress does not deliver a president a vote of confidence for his cabinets twice, the president can summon new legislative elections. But the rightwing populist opposition party Popular Force, led by Kuczynski s defeated electoral rival, Keiko Fujimori, answered Prime Minister Fernando Zavala s request on Thursday to back his cabinet with a resounding  no.  Peru s single-chamber Congress, where Popular Force has an absolute majority, voted 77-22 to dismiss Zavala s cabinet. Kuczynski now has 72 hours to swear in a new cabinet. While he cannot name Zavala as prime minister again, Kuczynski can reappoint other ministers in his cabinet. Going forward, Kuczynski might have a freer hand to govern in the remaining four years of his term if the opposition steers clear of a fresh confrontation out of fear of losing its majority. But several opposition lawmakers said they would welcome taking the battle to the ballot box.  If they close Congress, we re not afraid,  said Hector Becerril, a hard-line Popular Force lawmaker.  We re willing to seek the people s support again. And it won t be 13 seats we win, or 73. There ll be 100 of us!  The vote came on the eve of Kuczynski s 8-day trip abroad, which includes plans for dinner with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, a speech before the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday and a meeting with Pope Francis in the Vatican. Kuczynski, a 78-year-old former Wall Street banker who has vowed to modernize Peru and revive economic growth, took office a year ago with one of the weakest mandates of any president, having beat Fujimori by a razor-thin margin while his party only secured a small portion of seats in Congress. In a plenary debate that stretched on for more than seven hours, opposition lawmakers portrayed Kuczynski as an out-of-touch lobbyist who lacks authority and poses a danger to Peru. Congress has forced Kuczynski s former education and finance ministers to resign amid allegations of ethical breaches, while a third minister quit to avoid being censured. Popular Force announced this week that it planned to propose censuring Education Minister Marilu Martens over her handling of a teachers  2-month strike, which her supporters alleged was fueled by an alliance between Popular Force and extremists.  We can t deliver the head of a minister as a trophy,  Zavala told lawmakers after walking to Congress with the rest of the cabinet in a show of union.  It s clear to us that the country can t make progress like this.  ",

         "TAIPEI (Reuters) - A Taiwan court on Friday jailed a mainland Chinese man for 14 months for breaching national security laws, following months of strained relations over China s detention of a national from the self-ruled island. China, which sees Taiwan as a wayward province to be taken back by force, if necessary, severed official communications last year to pressure President Tsai Ing-wen, whose party traditionally favors independence, to concede its position.  Zhou Hongxu, formerly a student in Taiwan, was charged for seeking to arrange meetings between a Taiwan government official and a Chinese Communist party official outside Taiwan, in return for payment to the Taiwan official, a court document showed. Zhou  intentionally  jeopardized national security, though the attempt was unsuccessful, the court said in the document released after the verdict.    Zhou, who had met the Chinese official at a 2014 event in  Shanghai in 2014, did not plead guilty, his lawyer said, despite a confession during the trial that he later described as having  been made in improper circumstances.  He appeared in court on Friday in a calm mood and dressed in dark colors.  The court reduced his sentence, taking into account his confession, and the failure of the bid to breach national security, it said in its statement. On Monday, a Taiwanese activist, Li Ming-che, confessed in a Chinese court to attempting to subvert the Beijing government,  videos of his hearing released by Chinese authorities showed, although his wife refused to recognize the court s authority. Li, a community college teacher known for his pro-democracy and rights activism, had gone missing on a trip to mainland China in March. ",

         "Philippines orders retraining, reassignment of 1,200 police after alleged abuses",
         "MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine capital s police chief ordered that the entire 1,200-member police force in one of Manila s biggest areas be relieved of duty and retrained on Friday in response to a series of controversies, including the killing of two teenagers. Metro Manila s top officer Oscar Albayalde said all police personnel in the Caloocan area of the capital would undergo retraining and reorientation before being reassigned to other police units, not necessarily in Manila.  We will start with the city s police precincts 2 and 7,  Albayalde said. All personnel in Caloocan s headquarters and seven precincts would be temporarily replaced by the regional public safety battalion, a combat-trained unit.  This will be done in batches,  he said. Albayalde did not say how long the retraining would last and how long it would take for the entire police force in Caloocan to be replaced. It is the first time an entire city police unit has been relieved of its duties since President Rodrigo Duterte unleashed his bloody crackdown against illegal drugs 15 months ago, a campaign that has killed thousands of Filipinos. The move comes amid intense scrutiny of police activities in Caloocan in the wake of the killing of 17-year old Kian Loyd Delos Santos last month in what police said was an anti-drugs operation. His lawyers and family say he was murdered in cold blood. Three officers involved in his killing say he fired at them and they acted in self-defense. Duterte, known for his frequent speeches that call for drug dealers to be killed, ordered a thorough investigation into the Delos Santos killing and warned police he would not tolerate abuses. Another teenager, Carl Arnaiz, suffered a similar fate, accused of trying to rob a taxi driver and shooting at police who tried to arrest him. The taxi driver told reporters on Sunday he saw him alive in custody. About two dozen Caloocan residents, holding placards saying  Stop the Killings , held a noisy protest outside the precinct s police headquarters. Dozens of police trainees stood in front and watched the protest. Friday s order came only a day after Philippine media reported members of the Caloocan precinct 4 raided an elderly woman s home and reportedly stole money in an incident captured on closed circuit television cameras. Reuters could not confirm the report independently. Activists accuse police of executing suspected users and dealers systematically during anti-drugs operations and say official reports that say victims violently resisted arrest are implausible, and contrary to witness accounts. Police reject those allegations and Duterte has been furious at critics and political opponents who say he has a  kill policy . The video of the alleged robbery was uploaded on social media sites and went viral, which angered senior police generals. Albayalde immediately issued the orders to relieve the Caloocan precincts.  From what we have seen this has been done or will continue to be done by others so it is best to implement this preemptive measure to avoid similar incidents,  Albayalde told reporters. He warned other districts in Manila could face similar sanctions if they did not shape up. ",

         "Cambodia PM calls on U.S. to withdraw Peace Corps volunteers",
         "PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen called on the United States on Friday to withdraw Peace Corps volunteers in an escalating row over accusations that U.S. agents conspired with an opposition leader to plot treason. Hun Sen was responding after the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh issued a travel warning that urged citizens to show caution amid  anti-American rhetoric by officials .  Are you scaring Cambodians?  Hun Sen said of the United States in an address to garment workers at factories which export much of their production to the United States.  Are you prepared to invade Cambodia and that s why you told Americans to be careful? It s good if you pull out the Peace Corps,  Hun Sen said. The U.S. embassy declined to comment. It has previously dismissed the accusations of collusion with opposition leader Kem Sokha and called for his release. On Friday, the embassy was swearing in 71 new volunteers from the Peace Corps, which sends Americans abroad to help with local projects with the stated goal of promoting mutual understanding. Hun Sen said on Friday that he had ordered an investigation into whether any Americans were involved with Kem Sokha. Opponents of Hun Sen accuse him of arresting Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha and cracking down on independent media and other critics ahead of a general election next year. The evidence presented against Kem Sokha is a video recorded in 2013 in which he discusses a strategy to win power with the help of unspecified Americans. Hun Sen, a close ally of China, has taken a series of measures against U.S. interests this year from ending joint military exercises to expelling a naval aid unit to forcing a U.S.-funded pro-democracy group to leave. On Thursday, Hun Sen said he was suspending cooperation with Washington to find the remains of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. According to the U.S Embassy, more than 500 Peace Corps volunteers have served and worked in Cambodia since 2006, providing English teaching and teacher training as well as community health education.  U.S. President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961 to promote world peace and friendship. ",

         "Australia to move 200 asylum seekers to new PNG detention center",
         "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Approximately two hundred men held in a remote Australian-run detention center will be moved to a new facility within weeks, the country s immigration minister said. Peter Dutton, Australia s immigration minister, said those men who have their refugee applications denied, ruling them ineligible for resettlement to the United States, and who are from countries such as Iran which precludes forced deportations, will be transferred to a new detention facility within Papua New Guinea (PNG) after Oct. 31.  Those people, who total about 200, who have been found not to be refugees are to be moved into an alternative place of detention away from the regional processing center,  Dutton told Australia s parliament. Dutton s comments mark the first insight into how Australia plans to manage the end of its policy of detaining asylum seekers in PNG, where 800 men are held, many of whom for four years. Canberra s hardline immigration policy requires asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia to be sent for processing at camps on PNG s Manus Island and on Nauru. They are told they will never be settled in Australia. Question marks remain, however, about the fate of the remaining men on Manus as a refugee swap deal with the United States stalls. Former U.S. President Barack Obama late last year agreed to resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in Australian immigration centers in PNG and Nauru. In exchange, Australia agreed to take Central American refugees. Australia had hoped the men would have been resettled by Oct. 31 but with the swap deal stalling under President Trump after the U.S. hit it annual intake cap, Canberra is left seeking a solution. Australia s security contract with Spanish company Ferrovial SA will expire on Oct. 31, forcing the closure of the camp that has been subject to violence from locals.  PNG officials have sought to transfer the men to a transit center nearby but nearly all, citing fears of violence, have refused despite threats that it may rule them out of U.S. resettlement.  We are not willing to move from the center unless we are leaving for a country that is safe,  said one, who declined to be identified because of the fear it would jeopardize his application for U.S. resettlement.

         "Brazil's Temer faces new graft charges over JBS testimony",
         "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer was charged with obstruction of justice and racketeering on Thursday, according to a statement posted on the prosecutor general s office website, threatening to delay the government s economic reform agenda in Congress.    It is the second set of criminal charges filed against the president based on the plea-bargain testimony of the owners of the world s largest meatpacker, JBS SA. They accused Temer of taking bribes in return for political favors and of conspiring to buy the silence of a witness who could implicate the leader.  In a statement on Thursday, Temer strongly rejected all allegations of wrongdoing.  Temer s earlier corruption charge, that he took bribes from JBS officials, was blocked in August by Temer s allies in the lower house of Congress, which has the power to decide whether a president should stand trial by the Supreme Court. Despite the lower house s move to block the charges, they remain valid and can be pursued by prosecutors once Temer leaves office. His term ends on Jan. 1, 2019. Brazil s top public prosecutor Rodrigo Janot has also filed charges against Joesley Batista, the billionaire former chairman of JBS who implicated Temer. Batista was arrested on Sunday for concealing other crimes in his plea bargain deal. Batista s lawyer Antonio Carlos Kakay rejected the charges brought by Janot, arguing in a statement that the prosecutor had violated the rules of plea bargains by using his client s testimony to incriminate him. On Wednesday, Batista s brother Wesley, the chief executive officer of JBS SA, was also arrested for alleged insider trading to avoid hefty losses related to the May plea deal. Late on Thursday, Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin converted Joesley and executive Ricardo Saud s temporary detentions into preventative detention and gave them 10 days to respond before ruling on Janot s request to withdraw their plea deal.   The arrests of the Batista brothers have improved Temer s prospects of surviving the new charges and serving out his term through 2018. Temer and his allies expect the new charges to be voted in the lower house next month with wider support than he obtained in the 263-227 vote last month blocking a trial. Fachin heeded a request from Temer s defense not to deliver the accusation to the lower house until after a supreme court plenary vote on the matter. The vote should be held before Wednesday. The allegations are part of Brazil s sprawling corruption probes that have resulted in ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva s conviction and four pending trials; investigations and charges implicating three former presidents and dozens of members of Congress; and guilty verdicts against well over 100 powerful business and political figures.      Most of the schemes involve political kickbacks in return for contracts at government-run enterprises or cheap loans from Brazil s state development bank.     The racketeering charge against Temer was based on the plea bargain testimony of L cio Funaro, a businessman who accused the president and his closest aides in the ruling PMDB party of operating a criminal organization to collect bribes in exchange for political influence.     The obstruction of justice charge was based on testimony by Joesley Batista that Temer endorsed payments of hush money to try to keep Funaro from talking.     A short legislative agenda ahead of an election year, the absence of public pressure to oust Temer and the lack of any convincing replacement for him are also likely to weigh in the president s favor.      Given the short timetable, the general public apathy and lack of a viable alternative, it is quite possible that Brasilia will continue to punt this down the road,  said Matthew Taylor, a professor at the American University in Washington.

         "Saviors or profiteers? Bangladesh fishermen rescue Rohingya, for a price",
         "SHAMLAPUR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - For tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims, an informal fleet of small wooden fishing boats has meant deliverance from what they say is an indiscriminate assault on their villages by the Myanmar army. Deliverance, however, comes at a price. Some refugees told Reuters they paid as much as 10,000 taka ($122) per adult to boatmen to make the five-hour crossing from Myanmar s coast to ports in southern Bangladesh. While the fishermen say they have a moral obligation to help desperate fellow Muslims escaping persecution, Bangladeshi officials accuse them of profiteering. Ordered to stamp out what they call human trafficking, they have made arrests and even set fire to fishing boats.  Of course we want to keep going back to rescue more people. Our Muslim brothers and sisters are in a bad situation, so I have to go and bring them,  said Mohammed Alom, 25, a fisherman in the Bangladeshi village of Shamlapur. Around 400,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh in less than three weeks and people are still coming, by land as well as by sea, after attacks by Rohingya militants sparked a fierce counteroffensive by Myanmar s army. Senior United Nations officials have described the violence as  ethnic cleansing . The influx is placing huge strain on authorities in southern Bangladesh, one of the poorest parts of a poor country.  Don t say rescuers. The rescuers should be going and they should rescue people, not in terms of money,  said Lieutenant Colonel Ariful Islam, Border Guards Bangladesh commander in Teknaf on the country s southern tip, referring to the fishermen bringing refugees ashore.  These people are very poor, it s just extorting from them whatever they have. We are helping those who arrived, but we re trying to insist that no human trafficking should take place.  Reuters interviewed three Rohingya fishermen and two Bangladeshi boat owner-operators, all of whom had made at least two visits to Myanmar in recent weeks. The men didn t believe the profits they made detracted from what they saw as a rescue mission. Shaif Ullah, 34, a Bangladeshi, who co-owns a fishing boat, said he made 100,000 taka ($1,220) rescuing the family of a Rohingya in Malaysia who paid him via BKash, a popular mobile money service, after he returned to Bangladeshi shores.  People from Malaysia and Saudi Arabia call me and tell me to go there to get their family,  he said.  They are crying for my help. I take money from them, yes, but it s also a humanitarian act.   Two refugees have told Reuters their family members were detained by fishermen or brokers in Bangladesh when they could not pay for the journey. Several also complained they had to hand over gold and other jewelry to boat operators.  We had no chance to negotiate with the boatmen,  said Ali Johar, 75, an elder from his village in southern Maungdaw, just across the Naf river that forms the border between Myanmar and Bangladesh, now staying in Shamlapur. He handed over his wife s gold necklace and a gold ring, in addition to 7,000 taka for the rescue of him and about 30 members of his extended family, including young children, he said.  But we are grateful to the fishermen for bringing us here,  he said.  There were so many people trying to get here. If they didn t bring us, we would be stuck.  Pronay Chakma says it was a  stroke of fate  that thrust him into a key role in Bangladesh s response to the crisis. The 31-year-old administrator arrived in Teknaf to start a new job as sub-district assistant commissioner for land on Aug. 23, two days before northwestern Myanmar exploded into violence.  The thing is that, yes, the fishermen can go there, no problem, but if they demand money from the pain of stricken people, is it humanitarian? No,  he said. Chakma - a Buddhist member of the Chakma tribe who live scattered throughout South Asia - is an executive magistrate, which means he can hand down jail terms in simple criminal cases. He interrupted an interview with Reuters to sentence a man to three months for possession of five methamphetamine tablets. Chakma and another local official have sentenced at least 100 people to terms of up to six months for continuing to charge Rohingya refugees for ferrying them to safety.  Each and every time we are warning them,  he said.  Yes, you can do that, but not in exchange of money.  He pointed to the deaths of women and children who, unable to swim, have died after their boats capsized near Bangladeshi shores. Fishermen and local residents told Reuters that authorities have also broadcast messages in their villages by loudspeaker ordering them not to pick up Rohingyas. At least five boats caught bringing refugees in exchange for money have been set on fire on the beach by officials. The boatmen Reuters spoke to said they were cautious about operating in bad weather and rejected allegations of coercion or detaining refugees. Tens of thousands of people may still be waiting to cross the mouth of the Naf river, according to estimates by refugees, fishermen and rights groups.  I would like to go back to bring these people, because Muslims are suffering,  said Bangladeshi boat owner Moni Ullah, 38.  For me, it s hard to sit here and not go there, because I have seen so many people crying on the beach.  ($1 = 81.9300 taka) ",

         "U.S. nuclear commander says assuming North Korea tested hydrogen bomb",
         "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (Reuters) - The U.S. general who oversees America s nuclear forces said on Thursday he was making the assumption that North Korea did in fact test a hydrogen bomb on Sept. 3, crossing a key threshold in its weapons development efforts.  Although Pyongyang immediately claimed it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, the United States had previously declined to characterize it.  Air Force General John Hyten, head of the U.S. military s Strategic Command, however, said he had a responsibility, as a military officer responsible for responding to the test, to assume that it was a hydrogen bomb, based on the size of the blast.  I m assuming it was a hydrogen bomb. I have to make that assumption as a military officer,  Hyten told a small group of reporters who were accompanying Defense Secretary Jim Mattie on a trip to Hyten s headquarters in Nebraska.  I m not a nuclear scientist, so I can t tell you this is how it worked, this is what the bomb was. ... But I can tell you the size that we observed and saw tends to me to indicate that it was a hydrogen bomb and I have to figure out what the right response is with our allies as to that kind of event.  The North Korean nuclear test, its sixth and by far most powerful, prompted the U.N. Security Council to step up sanctions. It followed a series of North Korean missile tests, including one that flew over Japan and another that the U.S. assessed to be an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM). South Korea s military said shortly after Hyten s remarks that North Korea fired an unidentified missile eastward from the Sunan district in its capital, Pyongyang. A hydrogen bomb usually uses a primary atomic bomb to trigger a secondary, much larger explosion. Such a weapon, with the first stage based on nuclear fission - splitting atoms - and the second on nuclear fusion, produces a blast that is much more power than traditional atomic bombs, or  pure fission  devices.  The sheer destruction and damage that you can create with a weapon that size is significantly of a concern,  Hyten said. Hyten said that despite the nuclear and missile tests, North Korea still had not demonstrated that it had a reliable ICBM that could deliver a nuclear warhead.  But he noted it was only a matter of time before its scientists achieved that, given the pace of testing.  It s just a matter of when, not if,  he said, adding it could be months or years. Experts doubt that President Donald Trump, like his predecessors, will be able to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear program through economic or diplomatic pressure. Current and former U.S. officials have declined to comment on operational planning but acknowledge that no existing plan for a preemptive strike could promise to prevent a brutal counterattack by North Korea, which has thousands of artillery pieces and rockets trained on Seoul. That raises the question of whether the United States might be able to live with a nuclear-armed threat from North Korea. A senior Trump administration official, speaking to reporters last week on condition of anonymity, said it was unclear whether the Cold War-era deterrence model that Washington used with the Soviet Union could be applied to a rogue state like North Korea, adding:  I don t think the president wants to take that chance.  Hyten, who would command U.S. forces in a nuclear war, expressed confidence in the U.S. nuclear deterrent.  Do we have the ability to deter North Korea from developing capabilities that could potentially threaten us? That s a different question,  he said.  But do I, U.S. Strategic Command, have the ability for the United States to deter an adversary from attacking the United States with nuclear weapons? Yes. Because they know the response is going to be the destruction of their entire nation.  ",

         "U.N. seeks 'massive' help for Rohingya fleeing Myanmar 'ethnic cleansing'",
         "DHAKA/YANGON (Reuters) - The United Nations appealed on Thursday for massive help for nearly 400,000 Muslims from Myanmar who have fled to Bangladesh, with concern growing that the number could keep rising, unless Myanmar ends what critics denounce as  ethnic cleansing . The Rohingya are fleeing from a Myanmar military offensive in the western state of Rakhine that began after a series of guerrilla attacks on Aug. 25 on security posts and an army camp in which about a dozen people were killed.  We urge the international community to step up humanitarian support and come up with help,  Mohammed Abdiker, director of operations and emergencies for the International Organisation for Migration, told a news conference in the Bangladeshi capital. The need was  massive , he added. The violence in Rakhine and the exodus of refugees is the most pressing problem Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced since becoming national leader last year. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday urged Myanmar to end the violence, which he said was best described as ethnic cleansing.       The government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejects such accusations, saying it is targeting  terrorists . Numerous Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine have been torched but authorities have denied that security forces or Buddhist civilians set the fires. They blame the insurgents, and say 30,000 non-Muslim villagers were also displaced. Smoke was rising from at least five places on the Myanmar side of the border on Thursday, a Reuters reporter in Bangladesh said. It was not clear what was burning or who set the fires.  Ethnic cleansing  is not recognized as an independent crime under international law, the U.N. Office on Genocide Prevention says, but it has been used in U.N. resolutions and acknowledged in judgments and indictments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. A U.N. panel of experts defined it as  rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups .       The crisis has raised questions about Suu Kyi s commitment to human rights, and could strain relations with Western backers supporting her leadership of Myanmar s transition from decades of strict military rule and economic isolation. Critics have called for her to be stripped of her Nobel prize for failing to do more to halt the strife, though national security remains firmly in the hands of the military. Suu Kyi is due to address the nation on Tuesday. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he had spoken with Suu Kyi and that she said she was working to get aid to areas affected by violence. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy had what one U.S. official called a  tough conversation  with Myanmar s ambassador to the United States on Wednesday ahead of Murphy s trip to Yangon this weekend. Murphy will be meeting with Myanmar government officials next week to voice concern about the state of the Rohingya people and to press for greater access for humanitarian workers and reporters, the State Department said. China, which competes with the United States for influence in Myanmar, endorses the offensive against the insurgents and deemed it an  internal affair , Myanmar state media said.  The counterattacks of Myanmar security forces against extremist terrorists and the government s undertakings to provide assistance to the people are strongly welcomed,  the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper quoted China s ambassador, Hong Liang, as telling government officials. But at the United Nations in New York, China set a different tone, joining a Security Council expression of concern about reports of violence and urging steps to end it. The council met on Wednesday to discuss the crisis and later  expressed concern about reports of excessive violence ... and called for immediate steps to end the violence in Rakhine, de-escalate the situation, re-establish law and order, ensure the protection of civilians ... and resolve the refugee problem . This week, the Trump administration called for protection of civilians. Bangladesh says the refugees will have to go home and has called for safe zones in Myanmar. Myanmar says safe zones are unacceptable. The IOM s Abdiker declined to say how many refugees he thought might end up in Bangladesh.  The number may rise to 600,000, 700,000, even one million if the situation in Myanmar does not improve,  he said. The most important thing was that the refugees be able to go home safely, said George William Okoth-Obbo, assistant high commissioner for operations at the U.N. refugee agency.  The international community has to support to ensure their return ... peacefully and with safety,  he told the news conference. On Wednesday, the Myanmar government said 45 places had been burned. It did not provide details, but a spokesman said out of 471 villages in the north of Rakhine, 176 had been deserted and at least some people had left 34 more. The spokesman, Zaw Htay, said the people going to Bangladesh were either linked to the insurgents, or women and children fleeing conflict. Government figures show 432 people have been killed, most of them insurgents, since Aug. 25. ",

         "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hurricane Max was downgraded to a tropical storm on Thursday evening, bearing down on a region with the popular tourist resorts of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa.  Max s maximum sustained winds decreased to 70 miles per hour (113 km per hour) on Thursday evening, and the storm was about 80 miles (129 km) east of Acapulco, the National Hurricane Center in Florida said. The storm is expected to continue weakening dramatically as it moves inland over Southern Mexico, and it will likely be downgraded to a tropical depression on Thursday evening.  Nevertheless, the center warned of heavy rains and flooding in the coastal states of Guerrero and Oaxaca.  In the state of Guerrero, home to some of Mexico s major tourist resorts, Max could dump as much as 20 inches (51 cm) of rain in coastal areas, the NHC said, potentially triggering flash floods and mudslides.  The storm is bad news for Acapulco as tourists prepare to travel to the city to celebrate Mexico s Independence Day this weekend.  Meanwhile, tropical storm Norma formed in the Pacific on Thursday, according to the NHC. The storm, which is currently 360 miles (579 km) south of Cabo San Lucas, on the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, could become a hurricane by late Friday.  Max arrives a week after a powerful 8.1-magnitude quake shook southern Mexico, destroying thousands of buildings in the state of Oaxaca and killing at least 98 people nationwide. ",

         "Western powers press Iraq Kurd leaders to shelve 'very risky' independence vote",
         "ERBIL/KIRKUK, Iraq (Reuters) - The United States and Western allies pressed Iraqi Kurdish leaders to ditch a  very risky  independence vote on Thursday, presenting an alternative plan in an attempt to avoid conflict between the oil rich region and central government in Baghdad. The referendum, slated for Sept. 25, has become a potential flashpoint in the region, with Western powers concerned it could ignite conflict with Baghdad and divert attention from the war against Islamic State militants.  Heading into a referendum for Sept. 25, there is no prospect for international legitimacy,  Brett McGurk, a U.S. special envoy, told reporters after a delegation also including the U.N. and Britain met Kurdish President Massoud Barzani.  This is a very risky process.  McGurk said he was encouraged that Kurdish leaders could embrace an alternative plan focusing on dialogue between the Kurdistan region and Baghdad and a delay in the referendum. He refused to give details.  The Kurdish presidency said the autonomous region s political leaders would study the proposal, without giving details. But Barzani himself was later quoted by local media as telling a pro-independence rally the vote would go ahead on Sept. 25 as planned. The move came after Iraq s parliament voted to remove the governor of Kirkuk, a staunch supporter of Kurdish independence. Kirkuk Governor Najmaddin Kareem said he had no intention of following Baghdad s dismissal order, issued at the behest of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.  I will stay in office,  he told Reuters.  The referendum will go on as planned...The prime minister does not have the power to ask parliament to remove me.  Iraqi lawmakers authorized Abadi this week to  take all measures  to preserve national unity before the independence referendum.   Baghdad and Iraq s neighbors are opposed to the vote.      Iraqi lawmakers say it will consolidate Kurdish control over several disputed areas, including oil-rich Kirkuk. Turkey has the region s largest Kurdish population and fears a  Yes  vote could fuel separatism in its southeast where Kurdish militants have waged an insurgency for three decades in which more than 40,000 people have been killed. Iran and Syria also oppose the vote, fearing it could fan separatism among their own Kurdish populations. Iraqi lawmakers say the referendum will consolidate Kurdish control over several disputed areas, including oil-rich Kirkuk. Kirkuk province is claimed by both the central government in Baghdad and Barzani s semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq. Kareem is a vocal supporter of the referendum and campaigned for the vote also to be held in Kirkuk. Kurds have long claimed Kirkuk and its huge oil reserves. They regard the city, just outside their Kurdistan region in northern Iraq, as their historical capital.  But the ethnically mixed city also has Arab and Turkmen populations. Kareem has long riled the federal government. Last spring, Kirkuk s governorate voted to raise the Kurdish flag over state buildings, despite Baghdad s insistence that only Iraq s national flag should fly in the multi-ethnic city.    He (Kareem) is an elected governor of the council of Kirkuk,  said Hoshyar Zebari, a close adviser to President Barzani.  That is the only body that can remove him.   The escalating tactics this week by the Iraqis are causing a large public backlash, and will strengthen the Kurdish referendum enormously,  Zebari said.  Kurdish MPs in Iraq s parliament boycotted Thursday s vote, which produced a majority for the governor s removal, lawmaker Husham al-Suhail told Reuters. Asked whether parliament had the right to dismiss Kareem, Suhail referred to an article of Iraq s provincial law, which  parliament used as the legal basis for the vote and which stipulates the prime minister s authority to remove a regional governor. Suhail gave no details about what Kareem was accused of and Kareem himself said he had not been informed.  This is unlawful ... I have the support of the government council, I have the support of the people, we are here and we will continue,  he said. ",

         "TARRAGONA, Spain (Reuters) - The Catalonian government on Thursday launched its official campaign for an independence referendum, which Madrid has declared illegal, buoyed by the support of the capital  Barcelona. Crowds filled a bull ring in the northeastern city of Tarragona, applauding and shouting  We will vote!  as regional president Carles Puigdemont arrived to rally support for the Oct. 1 vote. In a boost for the credibility of the referendum, the mayor of Barcelona said earlier on Thursday that the vote would go ahead in the city, having previously expressed concern that civil servants involved may lose their jobs. A town hall spokesman was unable to comment further or explain how civil servants could be protected.      Puigdemont himself is facing criminal charges of misuse of public money, disobedience and abuse of office for organizing the referendum, and prosecutors have summoned hundreds of the region s mayors for questioning.    Police raided a newspaper office and a printing press last week, looking for signs of preparation, and the regional court has ordered Civil Guard agents to shut down web pages providing information about the referendum.  Regional home affairs councillor Joaquim Forn said there was a bigger than usual presence of national police in Catalonia.  They are moving throughout the region. They must be looking for ballot boxes,  he told RAC1 radio. A majority of Catalonia s 5.5 million voters want to have their say on the northeastern region s relationship with Spain, but the independence cause has lost support in recent years and surveys indicate less than 50 percent of the population would choose full self-rule.

         "North Korea threatens to 'sink' Japan, reduce U.S. to 'ashes and darkness'",
         "SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - A North Korean state agency threatened on Thursday to use nuclear weapons to  sink  Japan and reduce the United States to  ashes and darkness  for supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution and sanctions over its latest nuclear test. The Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, which handles the North s external ties and propaganda, also called for the breakup of the Security Council, which it called  a tool of evil  made up of  money-bribed  countries that move at the order of the United States.  The four islands of the archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche. Japan is no longer needed to exist near us,  the committee said in a statement carried by the North s official KCNA news agency.   Juche is the North s ruling ideology that mixes Marxism and an extreme form of go-it-alone nationalism preached by state founder Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong Un. Regional tension has risen markedly since the reclusive North conducted its sixth, and by far its most powerful, nuclear test on Sept. 3, following a series of missile tests, including one that flew over Japan. The 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on a U.S.-drafted resolution and a new round of sanctions on Monday in response, banning North Korea s textile exports that are the second largest only to coal and mineral, and capping fuel supplies. The North reacted to the latest action by the Security Council, which had the backing of veto-holding China and Russia, by reiterating threats to destroy the United States, Japan and South Korea.  Let s reduce the U.S. mainland into ashes and darkness. Let s vent our spite with mobilization of all retaliation means which have been prepared till now,  the statement said. Japan s Nikkei stock index and dollar/yen currency pared gains, although traders said that was more because of several Chinese economic indicators released on Thursday rather than a reaction to the North s latest statement. South Korea s won also edged down around the same time over domestic financial concerns. Despite the North s threats, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he was against having nuclear weapons in his country, either by developing its own arsenal or bringing back U.S. tactical nuclear weapons that were withdrawn in the early 1990s.  To respond to North Korea by having our own nuclear weapons will not maintain peace on the Korean peninsula and could lead to a nuclear arms race in northeast Asia,  Moon said in an interview with CNN. South Korea s Unification Ministry also said it planned to provide $8 million through the U.N. World Food Programme and UNICEF to help infants and pregnant women in the North. The move marks Seoul s first humanitarian assistance for the North since its fourth nuclear test in January 2016 and is based on a longstanding policy of separating humanitarian aid from politics, the ministry said. The North s latest threats also singled out Japan for  dancing to the tune  of the United States, saying it should never be pardoned for not offering a sincere apology for its  never-to-be-condoned crimes against our people , an apparent reference to Japan s wartime aggression. It also referred to South Korea as  traitors and dogs  of the United States. Japan criticized the North s statement harshly.  This announcement is extremely provocative and egregious. It is something that markedly heightens regional tension and is absolutely unacceptable,  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, visiting India, called for strict enforcement of the U.N. resolution, saying the world must force a change. The 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on a U.S.-drafted resolution and a new round of sanctions against North Korea on Monday in response to its latest and most powerful test, banning North Korea s textile exports that are the second largest only to coal and mineral, and capping fuel supplies. North Korea had already rejected the Security Council resolution, vowing to press ahead with its nuclear and missile programs. A tougher initial U.S. draft of Monday s resolution was weakened to win the support of China, the North s lone major ally, and Russia. Significantly, it stopped short of imposing a full embargo on oil exports to North Korea, most of which come from China. The latest sanctions also make it illegal for foreign firms to form commercial joint ventures with North Korean entities. U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed that North Korea will never be allowed to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile, but has also asked China to do more to rein in its neighbor. China in turn favors an international response to the problem. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the international community had reached a  high consensus  on trying to realize a peaceful solution.  We urge the relevant directly involved parties to seize the opportunity and have the political nerve to make the correct political choice as soon as possible,  Hua told a regular press briefing. The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty.

Netanyahu was joined by a business delegation including representatives from communications firm AudioCodes Ltd, cyber security firm Verint Systems Inc and Mer Group, which specializes in telecommunications and cyber security. In Central America, Pena Nieto said Israel s assistance could bolster the United States and Mexico s efforts in the region, particularly in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. He noted that Israel brings experience from carrying out development projects in Africa. The United States and Mexico have been seeking to encourage investment in infrastructure improvements in Central America s so-called Northern Triangle in an effort to stem migration to the United States. Netanyahu s trip marked the first visit to Mexico by a sitting Israeli prime minister, Pena Nieto said. At the close of the news conference, Netanyahu invited Pena Nieto to Jerusalem. The relationship between the nations was strained earlier this year by a tweet in which Netanyahu appeared to praise U.S. President Donald Trump s plans to build a wall on the Mexican border. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin later issued a statement apologizing for any misunderstanding. ",

         "U.S. extends some Iran sanctions relief under nuclear deal",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday extended some sanctions relief for Iran under the 2015 nuclear deal but said it has yet to decide whether to preserve the deal itself, the State Department said. President Donald Trump, who must make a decision by mid-October that could undermine the agreement, said Iran is violating  the spirit  of the 2015 deal under which Iran got sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear program. In a sign of Trump s desire to put pressure on Iran, which denies violating the deal, the U.S. Treasury announced new cyber-related and other sanctions on seven Iranian individuals, two Iranian entities and two Ukraine-based entities.  We are not going to stand for what they are doing,  Trump told reporters on Air Force One. But he stopped short of saying whether he will refuse to recertify the agreement. Trump must decide in October whether to certify that Iran is complying with the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). If he does not, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. The prospect of Washington reneging on the agreement has worried some of the key U.S. allies that helped negotiate the deal, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis, North Korea s nuclear and ballistic missile development. Republican Senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and wrote the law giving Congress the right to review the Iran deal, said he and the White House were preparing in case of a change in policy. He also said he recognized the need to work with allies.  I think it s important that ... we take steps that, to the extent we can, we keep all of our allies together,  Corker told Reuters.  What you don t want to do is self-create a crisis for no reason. You want to make sure that you have an outcome here that is a good outcome for the United States and our interest.  Asked if it made sense to abandon the Iran nuclear deal given concerns about North Korea, Corker said,  I don t think you should prejudge what they re (the administration) going to do.  Separately, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson argued that the United States must consider the full threat it says Iran poses to the Middle East when formulating its new policy toward Tehran, saying Iran had breached the spirit of the deal.  We have to consider the totality of Iran s activities and not let our view be defined solely by the nuclear agreement,  he told a news conference in London. Citing the preface to the 2015 agreement, Tillerson said  in our view, Iran is clearly in default of these expectations.  He cited Iranian support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, its development of ballistic missiles and  cyber activities.  The deal s preface does not oblige Iran to promote global peace. Rather, it says the nations involved  anticipate that full implementation of this JCPOA will positively contribute to regional and international peace and security.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters the administration had approved waivers of some sanctions on Iran to  maintain some flexibility  as it develops its Iran policy. She did not specify which sanctions were waived. Earlier, sources said the United States will renew a waiver of the most punitive sanctions on Iran. Tucked into Section 1245 of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, Washington threatened to sanction the banks of Iran s main oil customers if they did not significantly cut their purchases of Iranian crude. Under the law, these sanctions can be waived for a maximum of 120 days, forcing the U.S. government to revisit the issue every four months. Even as the administration waived the oil-related sanctions, the Treasury Department announced it had sanctioned 11 entities and individuals for  engaging in support of designated Iranian actors or malicious cyber-enabled activity.  Of the 11, seven were Iranian individuals, two were Iranian entities and two were entities based in Ukraine. The Treasury alleged they either supported Iran s ballistic missile program or its Quds Force, or engaged in cyber attacks against the U.S. financial system. The action freezes any assets they may hold in the United States and generally prohibits U.S. individuals from doing business with them. ",

         "LONDON (Reuters) - Myanmar is facing a  defining moment  and must stop the violence against its ethnic minority Rohingya population, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday. Attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts last month triggered an army operation that has killed more than 400 people, destroyed over 6,800 houses and sent nearly 400,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh.

The American surrendered to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of mostly Arab and Kurdish fighters, on or around Sept. 12.

         "(Reuters) - On Friday, a cruise ship carrying around 3,000 passengers will dock at St. John s harbor in the Caribbean island of Antigua. It will not be where the passengers expected to land when they booked, however. The Carnival Plc ship was meant to dock in Saint Martin, 100 miles (160 km) to the northwest. However, Hurricane Irma devastated the island, wrecking its port and infrastructure, and leaving it out of bounds for tourists. Antiguan officials now expect the Carnival Fascination to visit every Friday, and have gotten about 25 calls from major cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd and Norwegian Cruise Lines looking to make stops through the end of the year. For Asot Michael, Antigua and Barbuda s minister for tourism, the unexpected arrival of thousands of tourists is a bittersweet bonus.  We are going to be benefiting. I don t want to benefit from others  misfortune after such a disaster,  Michael said.  But because the port is so damaged in Saint Martin, so damaged in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands, we re getting some of those cancellations. Those cruise lines now are making ports of call into Antigua.      Hurricane Irma left behind a stark divide in the Caribbean ahead of the winter tourism season that is the region s economic lifeblood. As travel to the region picks up again, cruise lines, hotels, airlines and other companies are directing customers to places that are able to host them, and away from the worst-hit areas.  Popular winter vacation spots such as Saint Martin, the British Virgin Islands and Saint Barthelemy that were devastated by the storm could be sidelined for weeks or months.  In 2016, 29.3 million tourists visited the Caribbean and spent $35.5 billion, both new records, according to the Caribbean Tourism Organization.   For Saint Martin and Saint Bart, the holiday season looks very compromised,  said Jean-Pierre Mas, chairman of French travel agency federation SNAV.  My sentiment is that the winter season is lost. Decisions to book for the winter season are taken right now.   Busy tourist destinations in the western Caribbean, such as Barbados and Trinidad, were well away from the path of the storm. Cozumel, on Mexico s Gulf Coast, got four additional visits this week as ships were rerouted to avoid the storm s impact, although Cozumel tourism officials said three cruises were canceled.  Florida, which was anticipating another record year for its $100 billion a year tourism industry, is expected to rebound in time for the peak winter travel months, Moody s Analytics said earlier this week. Walt Disney Co reopened its Orlando Disney World theme park on Sept. 12. The Florida Keys, however, wrestled with more severe storm damage. [nL2N1LR0N1] [nF9N1L0029] [nL2N1LS1HW] Some travel companies said they are still assessing the situation and had not made firm decisions about rerouting ships. Tour operator Virgin Holidays said that it was beginning to return to regular operations in Antigua, despite damage to some properties on the island.  Antigua wasn t as badly damaged as we feared, and we have reopened tourism there, although three resorts are currently not on sale because of the damage,  a spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said.  Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia are three big tourist examples that were not impacted.  However, the small island of Saint Martin, which France shares with the Netherlands, could miss out on much of its tourism season. French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday vowed to swiftly rebuild the islands of the French Caribbean, including Saint Martin, and a French public reinsurance body estimated a cost of at least 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) from the damage there and in Saint Barthelemy. [nL2N1LT1SF] [nL5N1LQ09G] Hurricane Irma badly damaged many hotels on the island, such as AccorHotels Mercure hotel. A spokeswoman for Accor said that while nobody had been hurt, the hotel would be closed until Jan. 8 at least.  While 70 hotel rooms remain operational, they are being used to house military forces and other staff that are supporting the relief effort. AccorHotels is offering cancellation and reimbursement for those who had booked stays at the hotel. ",

         "Irma shakes Havana's deadly crumbling buildings",
         "HAVANA (Reuters) - Roydis Vald s  dilapidated home on Animas Street in the densely packed center of Old Havana had been declared uninhabitable by Cuba s Communist authorities years ago, his neighbors said. After Hurricane Irma shook the Cuban capital - a crumbling architectural jewel of the Caribbean - Vald s and his brother  were found under a collapsed wall, just two of the seven people killed by falling buildings on the island. Havana s historic center, where baroque Spanish colonial-era palaces butt shoulders with sleek Art Deco apartment buildings, was already crumbling before it took a lashing from Irma - a visible reminder of the hardship caused by a 57-year U.S. trade embargo.  Residents fear the violent storm - the worst to hit the Cuban mainland since 1932 - will accelerate the city s decline. While the eye of the hurricane did not reach the capital, tropical-storm force winds and heavy rains of its outer bands, as well as a storm surge, wrought havoc on its decrepit buildings. Salty water from Irma s heavy rains that has seeped into the brick and mortar of the capital s buildings will worsen corrosion and likely cause a raft of new collapses, residents and architects warn.  Now when the sun comes out, that s when things will really start to fall apart in Havana,  said Berta Rodriguez, a 71-year-old pensioner who lives on Animas Street and knew Vald s and his brother well.  We spent years asking the state to remove them from there,  she said, crying.  The state has to answer for this.      Irma has shone an unwelcome spotlight on the Caribbean nation s housing problems at a tricky time for the government. Already dealing with a cash crunch in the wake of a steep decline in aid from its key ally, Venezuela, Cuba also faces a political transition as President Raul Castro steps down next year, symbolizing the passing of the baton from the generation that led the 1959 Revolution. Rodriguez, who evacuated to her son s sturdier home during the hurricane, says she has been asking the Communist authorities for a new home for more than 20 years, echoing the frustrations of many Havana residents. After the Revolution led by Raul Castro s elder brother Fidel, the Cuban state confiscated many of Havana s grand historic buildings and distributed them to poor and middle-class families who over the years have divided them into ever-smaller units. Maintaining those buildings in a punishing tropical climate, however, fell by the wayside as the Communist government prioritized universal healthcare and education, as well as building infrastructure in the impoverished countryside. With state salaries averaging $30 per month and credit hard to get, Cubans say they do not have the money to fix up buildings themselves.  A builder told me I need to repair the walls that are full of holes, but I couldn t find the cash,  said Rodriguez, who suffers from chronic bronchitis made worse by her badly leaking ceiling. About 4,400 cases of damage to housing were reported in the capital due to Irma, state-run media said on Thursday. Of those, authorities confirmed nearly 1,200 buildings were entirely or partially destroyed. The city is working on restoring damaged roofs and preparing two shelters for families left homeless, the newspaper Granma added. But this will solve only part of a far greater problem. The housing deficit in the nation of 11 million people rose last year by 30,000 to nearly 900,000 units, the government told parliament in July.  In Havana, it estimated a shortage of more than 200,000 homes. The state had built 316,595 homes between 1990 and 2013, an effort that the president of the Construction Commission Santiago Lajes Choy told parliament was still  insufficient.  Litza Penalver, whose sister s family lives in the building on Animas street partially destroyed by Irma, said authorities want to get residents out now.   They want to demolish it, to cover up their errors,  she said.  They want to oblige us to stay in a large shelter and wait (for a new house) but the wait can last 30 years - Cuba doesn t have the resources.  Many Havana residents say they would prefer to stay in their decrepit homes, no matter how dangerous, rather than move to large shelters that offer no privacy. Still, with the rainy season ongoing, many worry that more hurricanes could hit before it ends in November.  While Irma has exacerbated frustration with Cuba s housing problems, even dissidents say it is unlikely to fuel outright opposition to the government.  There might be more spontaneous, isolated expressions of discontent,  said Jose Daniel Ferrer, leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), one of the island s largest dissident groups.  But not organized protests with clear political aims given the high level of repression at the moment.  Rodriguez, Penalver and others on Animas Street said theirs was not a political problem and noted they were strong supporters of the Revolution that toppled right-wing dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959 and subsequently provided free healthcare and education to ordinary Cubans.  I love my country,  said Penalver, adding she had a Spanish passport but chose to live in Cuba.  I m not looking for political problems. I m looking for solution to the housing issue.  ",

         " (In this Sept. 13 story, corrects definition of intersex in paragraph 5.) SYDNEY (Reuters) - The alarming volume of hate-speech during Australia s ballot over whether to legalize same-sex marriage spurred parliament  to pass emergency legislation on Wednesday to outlaw opponents spewing their vitriol while the vote was in progress. Australia began a non-compulsory postal vote on Tuesday that will determine whether it becomes the 25th country to legalize same-sex marriage. But with an emotionally charged campaign raising concerns about the welfare of vulnerable Australians, the government moved to strengthen laws preventing hate-speech. The opposition Labor Party supported the amendment, though it had rejected the need for a ballot on the issue. Until voting ends on November 7, anyone found guilty of intimidation, or threats to cause harm on the basis of the sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status - people who are born with genetic, hormonal or physical sex characteristics that are not typically male or female - or the religious convictions of someone will be liable to fines of A$12,500 (over $10,000) and a court injunction.  This bill cannot stop all of the hurt, all of the prejudice that is being expressed, all of the lack of acceptance that is being communicated to LGBTI Australians, to same-sex couple families. But it provides limited protections,  said Penny Wong, leader of the opposition in the senate. ",

         "U.S. must consider broader Iran threats when formulating new strategy:  Tillerson",
         "LONDON (Reuters) - The United States must consider the full threat it says Iran poses to the Middle East when formulating its new policy toward Tehran, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday, adding that Iran had breached the spirit of a 2015 nuclear deal.  Tillerson, made the comments during a visit to Britain to see Prime Minister Theresa May and foreign minister Boris Johnson. The trip was billed as focusing on the relief effort after Hurricane Irma, how to respond to North Korea s nuclear test, and resolving the political deadlock in Libya. But he was outspoken in his criticism of Iran when asked whether he believed it was meeting the obligations of a 2015 international nuclear agreement designed to curb an Iranian nuclear program in return for lifting most Western sanctions. Tillerson cited the preface of the nuclear deal, which calls on Iran to contribute positively to regional security.   In our view, Iran is clearly in default of these expectations ... through their actions to prop up the Assad regime (in Syria), to engage in malicious activities in the region, including cyber activities, aggressively developing ballistic missiles,  he told a news conference.  We have to consider the totality of Iran s activities and not let our view be defined solely by the nuclear agreement.  He was speaking before the United States announced it had imposed sanctions on seven Iranian individuals and two entities, alleging involvement in either malicious cyber activities or enabling Tehran s ballistic missile program. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously expressed doubts about the nuclear deal, and in April his administration said it would review whether the lifting of sanctions against Iran was in the United States  national security interest. Trump is weighing a strategy that could allow more aggressive U.S. responses to Iran s forces, its Shi ite Muslim proxies in Iraq and Syria, and its support for militant groups. Earlier on Thursday, a North Korean state agency threatened to reduce the United States to  ashes and darkness  for supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution and sanctions over its latest nuclear test. Tillerson said he was hopeful that China would decide to use the  powerful tool  of oil supplies to put pressure on Pyongyang, but conceded that it would be difficult to agree an oil embargo through the United Nations Security Council. North Korea carried out its sixth and largest nuclear test earlier this month.  I am hopeful that China, as a great country, a world power, will decide on their own, will take it upon themselves to use that very powerful tool of oil supply to persuade North Korea to reconsider its current path towards weapons development, reconsider its approach to dialogue and negotiations in the future,  he said. Commenting on violence in Myanmar against the minority Rohingya population, Tillerson said the country faced a defining moment.  I think it is important that the global community speak out in support of what we all know the expectation is for the treatment of people regardless of their ethnicity,  he added.  This violence must stop, this persecution must stop.  He said he understood that Myanmar s Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel prize laureate and de facto head of the government in Myanmar, was in a power-sharing agreement with the military and it was a  complex situation  in which she found herself.

         "Yemen's Houthi leader says could target Saudi oil tankers if Hodeidah attacked",
         "DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen s Houthi leader Abdel-Malek al-Houthi said on Thursday his group could target Saudi oil tankers should Saudi Arabia attack Yemen s main port at Hodeidah.   We could target Saudi oil tankers and we could do anything,  he said.  In a televised speech, the leader also said his group s ballistic missiles were capable of reaching the United Arab Emirates  capital of Abu Dhabi and anywhere inside Saudi Arabia.  It was unclear whether the Houthi group has the capability to carry out its threats. Abdel Malek said the Houthis had successfully fired a missile at Abu Dhabi earlier this month, meaning the United Arab Emirates was no longer safe from attack. He gave no further details and there has been no indication by the UAE of any missiles landing on their territory.  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter his country was not intimidated by Houthi threats.  The Houthis  comments threatening the UAE and its capital are tangible proof of the need for the Decisive Storm (operation),  Gargash said, referring to the Saudi-led coalition intervening in Yemen.  Iran s militias have vile objectives and represent a real threat,  he added. Yemen has been devastated by more than two years of civil war in which President Abd Rabu Hadi s government, backed by the coalition, is fighting to drive the Iran-allied Houthis out of cities they seized in 2014 and 2015 in a rapid rise to national power.  Today the port of Hodeidah is being threatened and we cannot turn a blind eye to that,  Abdel-Malek said.   If the Saudi regime and with a green light from the U.S. attack Hodeidah then we have to take steps that we haven t taken before.   The United Nations had proposed that the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, where 80 percent of food imports arrive, should be handed to a neutral party, to smooth the flow of humanitarian relief and prevent the port being engulfed by Yemen s two-year-old war. The government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi accuses the Houthis of using the port to smuggle in weapons and of collecting custom duties on goods, which they use to finance the war. The Houthis deny this. ",

         "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia accused the West on Thursday of  whipping up hysteria  over large-scale military exercises underway in eastern Europe and denied charges that they were being conducted with a lack of transparency. The exercises, codenamed \"Zapad\", or \"West\", started on Thursday and will last until Sept. 20. They are being conducted  on military ranges in Belarus, western Russia, Russia's exclave of Kaliningrad and in the Baltic Sea. (For graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2iIkjEU)  We reject complaints of these exercises not being transparent,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  We believe that whipping up hysteria around these exercises is a provocation.   It is a normal practice for any country to hold such exercises. Everything is being held in line with international law,  Peskov said. Russian President Vladimir Putin may visit one of the stages of these drills, he said.     NATO is closely watching the exercises and says they are larger than the 12,700 servicemen Moscow has publicized, actually numbering some 100,000 troops, and involve firing nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. Russia s defense ministry reiterated on Thursday that the exercises are of a purely defensive nature and are not a threat to any third country or group of countries. But NATO officials say the drills will simulate a conflict with the U.S.-led alliance intended to show Russia s ability to mass large numbers of troops at short notice in the event of a conflict. In a statement, the Pentagon said that while Russia and Belarus had taken some steps towards providing transparency, there were concerns about the official estimate of troop numbers.  We urge Russia to share information regarding its exercises and operations in NATO s vicinity to clearly convey its intentions and minimize any misunderstandings,  Lieutenant Colonel Michelle Baldanza, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in a statement.   In response to this uncertainty, the U.S. has built a joint, persistent rotational presence of air, land, and sea presence in the region to support our Allies,  she added. Amid allegations about Moscow s aggressive ambitions from its post-communist neighbors, Russia s defense ministry has said that it does not intend to use the drills as a springboard to attack Lithuania, Poland or Ukraine. Moscow says it is the West that threatens stability in eastern Europe, because NATO has put a 4,000-strong multinational force in the Baltics and Poland. Russia s defense ministry said the current drills involve some 7,200 troops from Belarus and 5,500 from Russia, up to 70 aircraft and helicopters, up to 680 units of military hardware, including 250 tanks, up to 200 artillery pieces, multiple rocket launchers and mortars, and up to 10 warships.

         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials are aggressively investigating what caused symptoms ranging from hearing loss to mild brain injury in 21 people linked to the U.S. Embassy in Cuba, a State Department official said on Thursday. Spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing that no new incidents had been reported since late August but testing continued, with 21 people saying they had been injured in what some media accounts have called an  acoustic attack.   We are, at the State Department, very deeply concerned about what has taken place and what has happened to our American personnel who have been serving at our embassy in Cuba,  Nauert said.  This has certainly turned out to be a difficult situation for some of our people.  The incidents, which began in late 2016, were first confirmed by a U.S. official in August. Nauert said at that time 16 people had been injured. Some of those had returned home for testing and treatment, Nauert said, while others had been tested in Cuba, where the embassy has a fulltime medical officer. News media have reported that Americans and Canadians working in Cuba have been diagnosed with hearing loss, nausea, headaches, balance disorders and conditions as serious as mild traumatic brain injury and damage to the central nervous system.  The investigation into all of this is still underway. It is an aggressive investigation that continues and we will continue doing this until we find out who or what is responsible for this,  Nauert said. She said U.S. diplomatic security personnel had been able to look through the rooms of some of those injured and conducted searches but still had not determined the cause of the injuries. Nauert said people were still being tested and it was possible the number of injured personnel would rise. ",

         "Fearing Russia, Sweden holds biggest war games in 20 years",
         "GOTHENBURG, Sweden (Reuters) - Neutral Sweden has launched its biggest war games in two decades with support from NATO countries, drilling 19,000 troops after years of spending cuts that have left the country fearful of Russia s growing military strength. On the eve of Russia s biggest maneuvers since 2013, which NATO says will be greater than the 13,000 troops Moscow says are involved, Sweden will simulate an attack from the east on the Baltic island of Gotland, near the Swedish mainland.  The security situation has taken a turn for the worse,  Micael Byden, the commander of the Swedish Armed Forces, said during a presentation of the three-week-long exercise.  Sweden, like the Baltics, Poland and much of the West, has been deeply troubled by Russia s 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Black Sea peninsula Crimea and its support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.   Russia is the country that affects security in Europe right now with its actions - the annexation of the Crimea and continued battles in eastern Ukraine - so it is clear that we are watching very closely what Russia is doing,  Byden said.  Around 1,500 troops from the United States, France, Norway and other NATO allies are taking part in the exercise dubbed Aurora. Non-NATO member Sweden has decided to beef up its military after having let spending drop from over 2 percent of economic output in the early 1990s to around 1 percent, and is re-introducing conscription. The armed forces, which at one point could mobilise more than 600,000, stand at just 20,000, with 22,000 more Home Guard volunteers.   NATO generals say the Aurora exercise is not a response to Russian exercises that start on Thursday. But Byden, speaking as U.S. and French forces displayed mobile surface-to-air missile systems to be deployed during the exercise, stressed the importance of NATO for Sweden.   We are a sovereign country that takes care of and is responsible for our safety. We do this together with others, ready to both support and receive help,  he said. The United States shipped vehicles by sea from Germany, while France brought others by train. They are to be moved via a classified route to Sweden s east coast for the exercise where U.S. attack helicopters will play the enemy during Aurora.  The government is determined to stick to the country s formal neutrality. Sweden has not fought a war since it clashed with Norway in 1814. But like its non-NATO neighbor Finland, Sweden has been drawing closer to NATO, allowing closer cooperation with alliance troops, with a view to working together in the event of an armed conflict. ",

         "U.S. State Department names Russian defense, intel firms under sanctions law",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Friday named 39 Russian defense- and intelligence-related entities under a new sanctions law, belatedly taking a step to enforce legislation passed overwhelmingly by Congress. The law, which President Donald Trump signed on Aug. 2, requires sanctions on individuals who engage in “a significant transaction” with the Russian entities. Friday’s action does not itself impose new sanctions, and determinations will be made on a case by case basis, State Department officials said. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have complained that Trump has been tardy in enforcing the law, which required the list of Russian entities be ready by Oct. 1. The list includes major Russian arms makers as well as Rosoboronexport, the state-run Russian arms exporter. Also listed is the St. Petersburg-based Special Technology Center, which former President Barack Obama sanctioned in December, saying it played a role in Moscow’s hacking and other interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia has denied such meddling. State Department officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, indicated the Trump administration would move carefully in imposing sanctions and dealing with issues such as U.S. allies who buy Russian-made weaponry or spare parts. “There is a significance threshold that would exclude certain things that are less than significant,” one official said. “Obviously we’re going to consider the totality of circumstances.” State Department guidance released on Friday says that in determining whether a transaction is “significant,” officials would weigh its impact on U.S. national security; its size and scope; and the importance of the deal to Russia’s defense and intelligence sector. The law requires Trump to impose sanctions by Jan. 29 on transactions that are found to meet the definition and which took place after he signed the legislation in August. “We’ll be implementing the sanctions legislation robustly, in keeping with our understanding of Congress’ intent and the facts that precipitated that legislation, including interference in our election,” a second State Department official said. The same official did not dispute a report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had eliminated a department office charged with coordinating economic sanctions. The office traditionally had been led by a senior U.S. diplomat. The official added that individuals throughout the department work on sanctions and that coordination of such work would continue. ",

         "Democrats stood up for the American people but Republicans shouted them down and voted to strip health care from millions.Senate Republicans voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in the middle of the night early Thursday morning.Even though Republicans don t have any plan to replace it with, they used budget reconciliation rules to prevent Democrats from blocking the vote and took the first step toward ending critical patient and consumer protections Americans have been enjoying for a few years since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, including protections for women, young people, and people with pre-existing conditions.During the roll call vote, Democrats stood up one by one when called to voice their strenuous objections, only to be shouted down by Republicans.Senator Elizabeth Warren can be heard trying to deliver an emotional defense of the landmark healthcare law, but Republicans disrespected her and others by repeatedly declaring them to be out of order.Republicans went on to pass the budget resolution by a simple majority vote. And they did it in the most cowardly way possible in order to keep Americans in the dark about what they just did.Here s the video via Twitter.Al Franken, Elizabeth Warren among the parade of Democrats drowned out when defending Obamacare. pic.twitter.com/lkhcvxM0Tw  Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) January 12, 2017Ever since Donald Trump got elected, Republicans made repealing the Affordable Care Act their top priority even though Trump himself claimed he would prefer to have a replacement ready first.But that s not what happened at all and now millions of Americans will suffer because of the heartless actions of partisan hacks who only oppose the health care law because President Obama made it a reality.Republicans should be ashamed of themselves. People are going to die because of them and their hatred. And that should end all of their careers once and for all.

         "Boeing CEO sees 'near term' plane deal after Trump meeting",
         "(Reuters) - Boeing Co’s chief executive said on Tuesday that he and President-elect Donald Trump “made progress” on lowering the cost of the Air Force One presidential aircraft fleet and on a potential sale of Boeing fighter aircraft, and suggesting a deal could be struck soon. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg’s visit to Trump Tower on Tuesday marked another step in Trump’s efforts to use his bully pulpit to cut better deals with defense contractors. It also showed Boeing’s adroit use of the meetings to pursue its own sales and herald its importance to the U.S. manufacturing economy.  Trump has been pressuring defense companies on prices through Twitter posts and meetings. Last month he said a $4 billion contract for Air Force One was too expensive and should be canceled. Boeing has said it so far has a $170 million contract for design work on the heavily modified Boeing 747 planes and that no final figure for the fleet of planes had been established.  Trump also last month asked the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company to price a contract for Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to compete with Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter, which is famously over budget. While not offering details, Muilenburg said the “excellent conversation” with Trump could lead to a deal “in the very near term.” “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,” Muilenburg told reporters after the hour-long meeting. “That’s going to lead to substantial cost reductions.” On fighter jets, he said, “we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably.” Muilenburg praised Trump’s approach to negotiations.  “I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging business,” he said, noting that as the U.S.’ top exporter, Boeing supports 1.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs and 13,000 small and mid-sized supplier companies. “If you want manufacturing jobs, aerospace is the place to invest,” he said. “We’re proud to take on that mission and I think Mr Trump’s engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country.” “I appreciate the teamwork approach on this - I think it’s the right way to do business.” Boeing’s stock was down 0.6 percent at $157.87 in afternoon trade.

         "Trump administration nearing completion of Cuba policy review: sources",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is nearing completion of a policy review to determine how far it goes in rolling back former President Barack Obama’s engagement with Cuba and could make an announcement next month, according to current and former U.S. officials and people familiar with the discussions. President Donald Trump’s advisers are crafting recommendations that could call for tightening some of the trade and travel rules that Obama eased in his rapprochement with Havana but which are expected to stop short of breaking diplomatic relations restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility, the sources said. The policy review, coordinated by the National Security Council, is expected pick up steam now that Trump has returned from his first foreign trip, one administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump threatened in a tweet shortly after his election in November to “terminate” Obama’s approach unless Cuba made significant concessions, something its Communist leadership is unlikely to do. The White House said in February that Cuba policy was under comprehensive review and that human rights on the island would be a major part of any revised strategy. Obama implemented his Cuba normalization measures through executive actions that bypassed Congress, and Trump is believed to have the power to undo much of it with the stroke of a pen. But there are divisions within his administration over to what extent he should go, especially given that Obama’s opening to Washington’s former Cold War foe has created opportunities for American companies ranging from telecommunications to airlines. Some aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. businesses and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. A group of 54 U.S. senators reintroduced legislation last Thursday to repeal all remaining restrictions on travel to Cuba, signaling support for U.S.-Cuba detente on Capitol Hill. But the Republican administration has been under heavy pressure from Cuban-American lawmakers such as U.S. Senator Marco Rubio and U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart to take a much harder line than Trump’s Democratic predecessor. There is little support in the administration, however, for a full-scale reversal of Obama’s steps that began with a  breakthrough with Cuban President Raul Castro in 2014. Among the options under consideration are tightening restrictions on U.S. firms doing business with Cuban state or military enterprises and re-imposing stricter rules on  Americans traveling there, according to people familiar with the discussions. It remains unclear, however, which recommendation will make their way to Trump, though the sources said a list was likely to be ready for his consideration in coming days or weeks. “We’re getting closer,” an administration official said. An announcement of changes could come as soon as June, according to the official and people familiar with the matter. The Daily Caller newspaper reported on Sunday that Trump would announce policy changes in a June speech in Miami, citing sources from a group opposed to the broader U.S. economic embargo that remains in place against Cuba. But the timing could also depend on factors such as whether Trump fills key Latin America posts at the State Department and elsewhere that remain vacant, sources told Reuters. The White House considered making a Cuba announcement on May 20 to mark the 115th anniversary of Cuba’s independence, but that coincided with Trump’s overseas trip and the review also was not yet finished, the sources said.

         "OBAMA HID BIN LADEN PAPERS To Bury This Damning Evidence That Could Have Cost Him 2012 Election",
         "The Obama administration s well guarded Osama bin Laden documents were released on Wednesday by CIA director Mike Pompeo. The documents were seized in a raid after U.S. SEAL Rob O Neill killed Osama bin Laden. The Obama administration basically politicized the intelligence agencies when they hand-picked just a few of the 470,000 documents to release. They hid damning evidence that could have hurt Obama s chance at reelection in 2012 .OBAMA RAN THE CLOCK OUT AL QAEDA WAS NOT  ON THE RUN :Steve Hayes of the Weekly Standard:  In a manner of speaking, Barack Obama wanted what al Qaeda already had: a mutually beneficial partnership with Tehran. Revealing to the American people the truth about Osama bin Laden s cozy working relationship with the Iranian government might have fatally undermined that diplomatic quest, just as the ongoing vitality of al Qaeda, amply testified to in the bin Laden documents, would have contradicted Obama s proud claims in 2012 that al Qaeda was  on the run.  So Obama, with the eager cooperation of some in the intelligence community, bottled up the bin Laden documents and ran out the clock.IRAN S CLOSE TIES TO AL QAEDA COULD HURT THE IRAN DEAL:Within the documents is an assessment by a senior jihadist with al Qaeda   Tehran ties: how Iran supplied  everything needed,  including  money, arms  and  training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon,  including safe haven for other jihadis, the New York Post reported.The assessment is raising questions as to how much then-President Obama knew about Iran s ties to al Qaeda before making his controversial deal. And it points to the reason why the former administration might have kept the documents under lock and key.The Obama White House had this information for five years before making the nuclear deal that critics argued would ultimately make it easier for the terror state to build nuclear weapons. Bin Laden had called Iran a  main artery for funds, personnel and communication  for al Qaeda, the Post reported.That wasn t the only suspicious dealing Obama had with Iran. In August 2016, Republicans were furious over a reported deal Obama had made to release American hostages in Iran.The former administration denied paying $400 million in  ransom  for the hostages, arguing that it was part of a legal settlement in a long-standing case. However, it was only the first of three payments to the Iranians totaling $1.3 billion that took place after the hostage release, as the Wall Street Journal disclosed. And strikingly, much of the case came by way of plane-loads of cash in international currencies.But the revelations about bin Laden and the former administration don t end there.MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CONNECTIONS TO BIN LADEN:In one of the 10,000 videos files contained within the newly released documents, bin Laden is asked to name is his influences. The terrorist leader didn t hesitate, The National reported. From a religious aspect, I was committed within the Muslim Brotherhood. Bin Laden also suggested the Muslim Brotherhood sponsored his first trip as a young jihadi. It was the first time I travelled to a country where I did not know the language,  he writes.  I carried a pistol and went. The Brotherhood, they had poor knowledge about things. If they knew, I would not have had to travel through Syria to Antakya 12 hours by bus to reach Istanbul.

         "HARARE (Reuters) - A Belgian-based businessman on Friday challenged Zimbabwean First Lady Grace Mugabe s accusation that he duped her of a $1.35 million diamond ring and asked her to provide the court with evidence to back her lawsuit. President Robert Mugabe s wife Grace this week sued Jamal Hamed in a Harare High Court, accusing him of failing to deliver the 100 carat jewel she said she had ordered from him for her wedding anniversary last year. Grace, 52, who is seen as a possible successor to her 93-year-old husband, said Hamed had instead provided an inferior ring worth $30,000 and when she had complained had refunded only $120,000. But Hamed filed his own court application disputing the claim and demanded that Grace should supply the court with details such as a copy of the sale agreement and proof of payment before he put in his defense. Hamed s lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa said she had deposed the court papers on behalf of her client on Friday. In the court papers seen by Reuters, Hamed, a British national, said Grace should also provide proof that he in fact owned Zimbabwean companies the first lady wished to be sold to recover the money  When, exactly, is it alleged the payment was done? Full dates are required. Full details of the account holder, the account number and a copy of the account statement are required,  Hamed said in the court application. Grace s lawyer Wilson Manase did not answer his phone when contacted for comment. The court case has lifted a veil on the wealthy lifestyle of Mugabe and his wife, nicknamed  Gucci Grace  for her reputed dedication to shopping, at a time Zimbabwe is in the grip of a severe U.S. dollar crunch and cash shortages.

         "WHY IS THIS CRIMINAL ALLOWED TO JUST SKATE BY WITH SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF JAIL TIME?We know that this woman is working on a plea bargain but FIVE YEARS??? The two things that are so outrageous about this entire case are that there was NO OVERSIGHT and that this WENT ON FOR 8 YEARS!!!USING THE FEDS AS YOUR OWN PERSONAL PIGGY BANK:Lorena Loren s job was to help poor people find housing Instead, prosecutors say, she was stealing from the poor to buy booze, makeup, clothes and homes for her relatives.But after years of scheming, authorities say, the government caught on. IT TOOK 8 YEARS!In a public corruption case that surfaced in federal court today, Loren, the former executive director of the St. Clair Housing Commission, was charged with embezzling more than $300,000 in low-income housing funds and spending the money on herself and family.According to a charging document filed in U.S. District Court, Loren s scheme ran between 2008-2016 and benefited many family members, including her husband, son and son-in-law.Prosecutors say Loren s criminal activity started in 2008   five years after she was appointed executive director of the St. Clair Housing Commission, which administers federally funded low-income housing programs in St. Clair County.According to court records, Loren used her job in many nefarious ways, including:  She fraudulently used the housing commission s two credit cards to buy personal items for herself and relatives, including nearly $135,000 in online purchases from Amazon.com; $14,364 in purchases from Sam s Club in Port Huron, and $16,460 in purchases from various Walmart stores. The purchases included, among other things, adult and infant clothing, furniture, food, beauty supplies, medications and alcoholic beverages.  Her unauthorized Amazon.com purchases included $60,000 worth of bedroom furniture, mattresses, appliances and other household items for family members. The items were shipped to Loren s relatives in Georgia and Florida.  She embezzled $24,600 in commission funds to pay for her son s rental unit.  She lied on four government housing contracts by claiming that her son-in-law was the landlord of a rental property for low-income residents in Michigan, when it was really her home in Port Austin.  She falsified lease agreements and stole public housing money that was supposed to help poor people to rent a home for her son.  She  directed members of her family to establish bank accounts  so that federal rental subsidy payments could be deposited into those accounts. The relatives then used the money for their own personal use, including rent for their Florida residences.Loren is charged in what is known as an information, which typically means she is working on a deal with the government. She is charged with conspiracy to commit federal program fraud. If convicted, she faces up to five years in prison.Loren home Lorena Loren bought this $325,000 home in Georgia after federal prosecutors say she embezzled more than $336,000 from the St. Clair Housing Commission.JUDICIAL WATCH: HUD s inspector general has testified before Congress about the severe mismanagement at offshoots functioning independently yet federally funded in states across the country that have fleeced taxpayers out of hundreds of millions of dollars. He testified that his office discovered more than $200 million in questionable spending at local public housing agencies (PHAs) since 2012. PHAs are created by states, operate at the city or county level and administer the federal program known as Section 8 to provide low-income people with affordable housing. Many of these local public housing agencies are run by people with  troubled backgrounds  that somehow manage to remain in high-ranking positions at the agencies, the watchdog told lawmakers back in 2014.DR BEN CARSON NEEDS TO CLEAN THIS UP STAT!READ MORE: DFP",

         "Wait we thought Obama and the Democrats were supposed to be standing up to the  evil corporations  and standing up for the every day American?When it comes to official and media opinion on Obama s crowning trade  achievements , the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade And Investment Partnership (TTIP), the party line is united. As previously noted, Barack Obama has assured the population that this treaty is going to be wonderful for everyone:In hailing the agreement, Obama said,  Congress and the American people will have months to read every word  before he signs the deal that he described as a win for all sides. If we can get this agreement to my desk, then we can help our businesses sell more Made in America goods and services around the world, and we can help more American workers compete and win,  Obama said.The mainstream media s chorus of support for these trade deal is likewise deafening: here are some indicative headlines from this past Monday:Time Magazine: Pacific Trade Deal Is Good for the U.S. and Obama s Legacy  The Washington Post: The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a trade deal worth celebrating The far less popular opposing view, one repeatedly presented here, is that like with every other  free trade  agreement that the U.S. has entered into since World War II, the exact opposite is what will actually happen: the outcome will be that the US trade deficit (which excluding petroleum is already back to record levels) will get even larger, and we will see even more jobs and even more businesses go overseas, thus explaining the secrecy and the fast-track nature of the TPP and TTIP s passage through Congress.And while the US population, which is far more perturbed by what Caitlyn Jenner will wear tomorrow than D.C. s plans on the future of world trade, has been mute in its response to the passage of the first part of the trade treaty, the TPP   after all the MSM isn t there to tell it how to feel about it, aside to assure it that everything will be great even as millions of highly-paid jobs mysteriously become line cooks   other countries are standing up against globalist trade interests meant to serve a handful of corporations.Case in point Germany, where today hundreds of thousands of people marched in Berlin in protest against the planned  free trade  deal between Europe and the United States which they say is anti-democratic and will lower food safety, labor and environmental standards.TTIP critics fear that it would lead to worse safeguards in Europe, bringing down standards for consumer safety, food and health or labor rights down to those in America. European nations have stricter regulations for things like genetically modified foods or workers benefits than the US does. There is also discontent with the secretive nature of the negotiations, which prompts skeptics to assume the worst about the document they would eventually produce.The organizers   an alliance of environmental groups, charities and opposition parties   claimed that 250,000 people were taking part in the rally against free trade deals with both the United States and Canada, far more than they had anticipated. This is the biggest protest that this country has seen for many, many years,  Christoph Bautz, director of citizens  movement Campact told protesters in a speech.According to Reuters,  opposition to the so-called Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) has risen over the past year in Germany, with critics fearing the pact will hand too much power to big multinationals at the expense of consumers and workers. Popular anger appears to be focused on the encroachment by corporations into every corner around the globe: What bothers me the most is that I don t want all our consumer laws to be softened,  Oliver Zloty told Reuters TV.  And I don t want to have a dictatorship by any companies.  Via: Zero Hedge",

         " WATCH: Fox News Host Smacks Down Trump Supporter For Being A Hypocrite About Tax Returns",
         "Donald Trump still refuses to release his tax returns. So when Fox blowhard Eric Bolling tried to defend him for it he was utterly laid to waste by his own colleague.As usual, the panel of Fox hosts were busy trashing Hillary Clinton and attacking her over her recently released tax returns. But Bolling claimed that he cares more about the transcripts of Hillary Clinton s speeches to Goldman Sachs, remarking that he  really wants  to see them.Julie Roginsky then chimed in suggesting a trade in which Trump would release his tax returns in exchange for the release of the speech transcripts which drew approval from the panel. But Roginsky pointed out that she doesn t think Trump will do it because the New York Times reports that his tax returns will show that Trump pays zero percent in taxes while Clinton paid 43.2 percent in federal, state, and local taxes in 2015.In short, his tax returns would be embarrassing, and would spark outrage as it would be clear that Trump doesn t pay taxes while Hillary Clinton does.Roginsky s colleagues immediately jumped to Trump s defense by claiming that he can t release his taxes because he is being audited, but Roginsky didn t let that excuse fly. She pointed out that Trump is only being audited for a couple years of his taxes and said it doesn t stop him from releasing other years. In fact, an audit doesn t prevent releasing any tax returns at all even if they are under audit.Bolling, of course, continued making excuses for Trump and claimed that he can t release any of his taxes because the current audit could somehow affect his past returns. And that drew a sharp rebuke from Roginsky in which she called him out for being a total hypocrite. You are are coming up with Kool-Aid excuses! If this was Hillary Clinton, you d be the first to demand that she release those taxes. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, if Hillary refused to release her tax returns, Fox would immediately begin demanding that they be released and it would be a never ending topic from now till Election Day. But because Trump is the Republican nominee, Fox News has no problem defending him for refusing to release his own. That is except Julie Roginsky. She not only would like Trump to release them, she s tired of the lame excuses pushed by Trump apologists like Bolling.Featured image via screen capture",

         "In 2015, former professional boxer Anthony Small, was been cleared of plotting to leave Britain to join Islamic State militants in Syria.Apparently it s okay to threaten the lives of British citizens as long as you re not waving an ISIS flag while you do it.Vice  Small s flourishing boxing career came to an end when he converted to Islam at the age of 24. Now known as Abdul-Haqq, he decided the sport s lifestyle was incompatible with his hardline practice of the religion and took up preaching instead.An associate of the infamous Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and his banned organization Al-Muhajiroun, Haqq used social media to share his fundamentalist views of Islam. He regularly posted controversial videos filmed in his home, justifying IS beheadings and terror attacks such as the public killing of UK soldier Lee Rigby in 2013.Here is Anthony Small s most recent video where he targets Britain First co-founder Paul Golding former EDL leader Tommy Robinson along with conservative radio host Katie Hopkins. Keep in mind that Youtube is cracking down on conservatives for  hate speech  while this Muslim man is using Youtube to threaten the lives of 3 popular British activist. Censorship for conservatives is apparently more dangerous than death threats from professional boxers turned Muslim extremists:Haqq s views have led to multiple police raids on his house, as well as accusations of trying to join IS in the Middle East. VICE News spoke to Haqq on the run up to his arrest about police raids, Western foreign policy, and his faith. We then caught up with him again outside London s Old Bailey court after his release.Here s who  Anthony Small Boxer  really is.

         "Trump to visit CIA headquarters on Saturday: transition official",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump plans to visit CIA headquarters on Saturday on his first full day as U.S. president, as he takes command of an agency that he has harshly criticized, a transition official said on Thursday. The visit to Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in Langley, Virginia, in the Washington suburbs, has a symbolic element, since Trump had questioned the CIA’s conclusion that Russia was involved in cyber hacking that interfered with the U.S. election. A senior U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the purpose of Trump’s visit to the CIA’s sprawling campus was to swear in U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, as the spy agency’s new chief. However, that plan, will depend on whether Pompeo receives Senate confirmation by then, and it was uncertain whether the Senate would act in time. The Senate’s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said that “there are a good number of members” who want to make statements about Pompeo or ask him questions, and he predicted a vote on Monday if it did not take place Friday. Trump has since accepted the verdict of Russia’s involvement. But he raised hackles among intelligence professionals earlier this month when he accused them of leaks that led some U.S. media outlets to report unsubstantiated claims that Russia had collected compromising information about him. Trump had accused U.S. intelligence agencies of engaging in tactics reminiscent of Nazi Germany. After that blast, outgoing CIA Director John Brennan fired back on “Fox News Sunday,” saying Trump “has to be mindful that he does not have a full appreciation and understanding of what the implications are of going down that road.” ",

The leaders were set to meet on Friday on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam to discuss how to push ahead with TPP, but Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not show up, sources told Reuters.  As for TPP 11, a broad agreement has been reached at a ministerial meeting yesterday. But the Canadian side said today they are not yet at the stage where its leader can confirm the agreement reached among ministers,  Abe told reporters.

         " France’s President Confirms He Intentionally Humiliated Trump With That Handshake (VIDEO)",
         "It was the cringe-inducing handshake seen   and mocked   around the world. Trump sat down with the new president of France, reached out his hand, and this was the result.What made the situation that much more awkward for Trump is that he has a well-known, albeit bizarre, habit of trying to humiliate others with his handshakes. Repeatedly, he has gone into a handshake with a foreign leader only to yank their arms and pull them in. He s a 70-year-old who cannot do a simple handshake without making everyone uncomfortable.Macron was reportedly warned ahead of time that Trump s handshakes were designed to be as awkward as possible. A Washington Post writer described the moment Macron s adviser was tipped off that an embarrassing incident was coming: Did you warn him about Trump s handshakes?  my philanthropist friend asked. A look of surprise popped on Araud s face as he inquired what exactly did that mean. Both of us told him about Trump s affinity for the alpha male, grab-and-pull power pump that always seemed to reduce the other person to a rag doll. Forewarned, Araud said he would alert Macron.So Macron came prepared. And the result was that the tables were completely turned on Trump.That was, according to Macron s own admission, by design. In a follow-up interview, Macron said he grasped onto Trump s hand with an iron grip with the intention of showing Trump he wasn t about to be made a fool of. My handshake with him, it wasn t innocent. He added:  One must show that you won t make small concessions, even symbolic ones, but also not over-publicise things, either. Macron s office confirmed the veracity of the president s comments in Le Journal du Dimanche.He described the handshake seen  round the world as a  moment of truth  for Trump. The Republican president had come to bully his European allies   instead they, to a person, stood up to him. The handshake was a symbol of that defiance.Macron might turn into the go-to guy for how to subvert Trump s outsized ego. In a later moment of pure trolling, he subtly put Trump in his place with this brutal greeting.

         "ROME (Reuters) - Italian police said on Saturday they had seized more than 100 tonnes of contraband diesel from a ship which set sail from Libya and arrested the captain for smuggling and money-laundering. The ship, which was flying a Togolese flag, carried the fuel in several hidden cisterns, together with some 11 tonnes of contraband cigarettes, a statement from finance police in the Sicilian town of Syracuse said. The ship s captain, a 25-year-old Indonesian has been put under house arrest. The other four crew members, also from Indonesia, were not arrested. The ship was intercepted in Sicilian waters on Oct. 26 and prosecutors in Syracuse are still investigating exactly where the fuel was taken from and where it was intended to be sold, the statement said. Last month Sicilian police arrested six people, including a suspected mobster, and issued warrants for three others for running a Libyan fuel-smuggling ring in which at least 30 million euros ($35 million) of diesel was sold in gas stations in Italy and Europe.

         "OSCE watchdog criticizes German social media law as too broad",
         "VIENNA (Reuters) - The OSCE media watchdog on Wednesday criticized a German law designed to fine social media networks for dragging their feet in removing hateful postings for being too broad and called on lawmakers to consider amending it. The German parliament in June approved legislation, in force since the beginning of the month, that allows authorities to punish groups such as Facebook or Twitter if they do not promptly delete hate postings.     Harlem Desire, the media freedom chief of the 57-state Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, said he hoped the German law would encourage providers to speedily process users  complaints, but added its effects could be excessively restrictive.  I appeal to the German authorities to take steps to ensure the careful implementation of the law, evaluate its effects and be ready to amend it in parliament, if necessary, as in its current form, the law may have a chilling effect on freedom of expression,  Desire said in a statement.  According to the law s provisions, decisions to remove content considered unlawful or illegitimate from social networks rests with the operators of those networks, who may remove more than is necessary or proportionate, and the list of offences for which content may be deleted is very broad.  Germany has some of the world s toughest laws covering defamation, public incitement to commit crimes and threats of violence, with prison sentences for Holocaust denial or inciting hatred against minorities. However, few online cases are prosecuted. The new law gives social media networks 24 hours to delete or block obviously criminal content and seven days to deal with less clear-cut cases, with an obligation to report back to the person who filed the complaint about how they handled the case. Failure to comply could see a company fined up to 50 million euros ($59 million), and the company s chief representative in Germany fined up to 5 million euros. Critics of a new hate speech law in Germany are optimistic that it can be revised after its Social Democratic sponsors vowed to drop out of the ruling coalition following last month s national election and go into opposition.

         "WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland wants to be sure that Christian traditions are not subject to  ideological censorship  in the European Union, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said on Thursday, emphasizing her party s opposition to Muslim immigration. Along with Hungary, Poland has refused to take in any of its quota of the wave of refugees from Syria and elsewhere who have come to Europe since 2015, on the grounds that Muslim immigrants are a threat to their national security and stability. Szydlo s eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party appeals directly to the more socially conservative sections of Poland s overwhelmingly Roman Catholic population. In a foreign policy speech marking the midpoint of the parliamentary term, Szydlo said Christians in Europe should not need to feel uncomfortable or ashamed about their faith and traditions.  We are in favor of (an EU) where Christian traditions are not subject to ideological censorship,  she told a conference organized by the Polish Institute of International Affairs. Opinion polls in Poland - one of the most ethnically and religiously homogenous countries in Europe - indicate that about three-quarters of Poles are against accepting refugees.     Apart from refusing its quota, Szydlo s government has triggered a series of disputes with the EU executive, the European Commission, over policies that Brussels says undermine democracy and the rule of law. In a veiled criticism of France and Germany, the traditional motors of EU integration, Szydlo said that countries such as Poland should be a greater part of the bloc s decision-making process.  The EU s principle of respect for the rights of its citizens will cease to be an empty one only when the debate about the future of the European Union takes place with the participation of all concerned, not in three or four capitals,  she said.  Opinion polls suggest up to 80 percent of Poles back EU membership, though many are also opposed to deeper EU integration and joining the euro currency. Szydlo reiterated that Poland would stay in the EU, but said that growing euroscepticism in several countries was a sign that  some politicians  were unwilling to recognize the problems within the bloc.   It s not enough to stigmatize tens of millions of Europeans in different countries as immature and dangerous populations, or to put Poland in a corner,  Szydlo said. ",

         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The deputy director of the U.S. National Security Agency, the intelligence agency in charge of electronic surveillance and code-breaking, is retiring, an NSA spokesman said on Friday. Richard Ledgett, who just turned 59, will retire in the spring, spokesman Michael Halbig said in an emailed statement. “It has been anticipated that he would retire in 2017 and he decided the time is right this spring after nearly 40 years of service to the nation.” Ledgett played a central role in the agency’s response to massive leaks of U.S. surveillance programs by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Ledgett is among the many top U.S. intelligence officials who have announced they are leaving since Donald Trump’s victory in the Nov. 8 election. In the UK, the head of NSA’s British counterpart agency  GCHQ, Robert Hannigan, announced two weeks ago that he was stepping down for family reasons. The NSA has faced continued challenges since Snowden’s 2013 revelations, believed to be the largest leak in the secretive agency’s 65-year history. Another NSA contractor, Harold Thomas Martin, is facing espionage charges for allegedly stealing vast amounts of classified information. In November, the head of the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence community recommended to then-President Barack Obama that NSA’s director, Navy Admiral Michael Rogers, be removed from his post, sources familiar with the matter said. Obama took no action in the matter, which the Washington Post first reported. ",

         " Trump Literally Just Said He’d Take Guns Away From Anyone Without Due Process",
         "In discussing shootings and crime in the first of three presidential debates, Donald Trump not only greatly exaggerated the number of shootings in Chicago, and claimed that stop and frisk was both constitutional and effective, he also advocated taking guns away from people without due process. Of course, he thinks that the police would only take guns away from criminals, and that the Constitution is different for criminals, but everyone has a constitutional right to due process. Doesn t matter to Trump, though: We have to take guns away from bad people that shouldn t have them. Those were Trump s words in the debate, where he defended stop-and-frisk as constitutional despite the fact that it was literally ruled otherwise, and has also been deemed ineffective. How the NRA can possibly support a candidate that would take guns away from anybody at all without due process is beyond us. That s especially true given the fact that this isn t the first time Trump has said this: [Police officers are] proactive, and if they see a person possibly with a gun or they think they have a gun, they will see the person and they ll look and they ll take the gun away. They ll stop, they ll frisk and they ll take the gun away, and they won t have anything to shoot with. The 2nd Amendment cannot exist without due process. The NRA is literally supporting a candidate who would take guns away from law-abiding citizens. Literally.Featured image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",

         "In Beijing, Trump presses China on North Korea and trade",
         "BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump pressed China to do more to rein in North Korea on Thursday and said bilateral trade had been unfair to the United States, but praised President Xi Jinping’s pledge that China would be more open to foreign firms. On North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, Trump said “China can fix this problem quickly and easily”, urging Beijing to cut financial links with North Korea and also calling on Russia to help. Trump was speaking alongside Xi in the Chinese capital to announce the signing of about $250 billion in commercial deals between U.S. and Chinese firms, a display that some in the U.S. business community worry detracts from tackling deep-seated complaints about market access in China. Xi said the Chinese economy would become increasingly open and transparent to foreign firms, including those from the United States, and welcomed U.S. companies to participate in his ambitious “Belt and Road” infrastructure-led initiative. Trump made clear that he blamed his predecessors, not China, for the trade imbalance, and repeatedly praised Xi, calling him “a very special man”. “But we will make it fair and it will be tremendous for both of us,” Trump said. Xi smiled widely when Trump said he does not blame China for the deficit and also when Trump said Xi gets things done. “Of course there are some frictions, but on the basis of win-win cooperation and fair competition, we hope we can solve all these issues in a frank and consultative way,” Xi said. “Keeping opening up is our long-term strategy. We will never narrow or close our doors. We will further widen them,” he said. China would also offer a more fair and transparent environment for foreign firms, including U.S. ones, Xi said. Trump is pressing China to tighten the screws further on North Korea and its development of nuclear weapons in defiance of U.N. sanctions. At least modest progress is hoped for, although there are no immediate signs of a major breakthrough, a U.S. official said earlier. Referring to Xi, Trump said: “I do believe there’s a solution to that, as do you.” Xi reiterated that China would strive for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula but offered no hint that China would change tack on North Korea, with which it fought side-by-side in the 1950-53 Korean war against U.S.-led forces. “We are devoted to reaching a resolution to the Korean peninsula issue through dialogue and consultations,” Xi said. Briefing reporters after the talks, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump told Xi: “You’re a strong man, I’m sure you can solve this for me.” Tillerson said both leaders agreed they could not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea but he acknowledged they had some differences over tactics and timing. Tillerson pointed out that Trump, in a speech in Seoul, had “invited the North Koreans to come to the table,” in line with the Chinese desire for a negotiated solution. He added, however, that Trump was prepared for a “military response” if he deemed the threat serious enough, but “that’s not his first choice”. “We are going to work hard on diplomatic efforts as well,” he said, but did not elaborate. In a show of the importance China puts on Trump’s first official visit, Thursday’s welcoming ceremony outside Beijing’s Great Hall of the People overlooking Tiananmen Square was broadcast live on state television - unprecedented treatment for a visiting leader. Earlier on Thursday, Xi said he had a deep exchange of views with Trump and reached consensus on numerous issues of mutual concern. “For China, cooperation is the only real choice, only win-win can lead to an even better future,” he said. Xi said China and the United States strengthened high-level dialogue on all fronts over the past year and boosted coordination on major international issues, such as the Korean peninsula and Afghanistan. “Relations between China and the United States are now on a new historical starting point,” Xi said. Trump and Xi hit it off at their first meeting in April at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and continued their “bromance” on Wednesday with an afternoon of sightseeing together with their wives. However, divisions persist over trade and North Korea. And while Xi is riding high after consolidating power at a twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress last month, Trump comes to China saddled with low public approval ratings and dogged by investigations into Russian links to his election campaign. Trump has ratcheted up his criticism of China’s massive trade surplus with the United States - calling it “embarrassing” and “horrible” last week - and has accused Beijing of unfair trade practices. For its part, China says U.S. restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and on high-tech exports need to be addressed. Several corporate chief executives were in Beijing as part of a delegation led by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, with General Electric and semiconductor maker Qualcomm Inc among those announcing billions of dollars in sales to China. [L3N1NF2IA] But Qualcomm’s agreement to sell $12 billion worth of components to three Chinese mobile phone makers over three years is non-binding, and critics say such public announcements are sometimes more show than substance. “This shows that we have a strong, vibrant bilateral economic relationship, and yet we still need to focus on leveling the playing field because U.S. companies continue to be disadvantaged doing business in China,” said William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. Trump railed against China’s trade practices during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and threatened to take action once in office. But he has since held back on any major trade penalties, making clear he was doing so to give Beijing time to make progress reining in North Korea. A U.S. official said both sides were “in sync” about wanting to minimize friction during the visit and recreate the positive tone of the April summit. Trump was not expected to put much emphasis in his talks with Xi on thorny issues such as the disputed South China Sea and self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by China as its own, although the leaders’ aides may deal with those matters privately, the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. China has repeatedly pushed back at suggestions it should be doing more to rein in North Korea, which does about 90 percent of its trade with China, saying it is fully enforcing U.N. sanctions and that everyone has a responsibility to lower tension and get talks back on track.

         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democrat who sits on the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) is planning to resign before her term expires amid frustrations about partisan gridlock, the New York Times reported on Sunday. FEC Commissioner Ann Ravel told the Times in an interview she intended to submit her letter of resignation this week, a move that would open the door for President Donald Trump to make his own appointment to the panel. “The ability of the commission to perform its role has deteriorated significantly,” Ravel told the newspaper.  “I think I can be more effective on the outside.” Ravel said she was particularly frustrated about split votes among the FEC’s three Democrats and three Republicans. The lack of consensus among the FEC’s members has made it impossible to rein in campaign abuses, she said. Ravel told the New York Times she planned to return to California, where she previously worked as a state regulator identifying dark money that flowed into state elections. ",

         " Trump Tries To Blame Obama For North Korea Mess, It Immediately Backfires (TWEETS)",
         "In his current position of having a historically low approval rating and a running track record of multiple colossal failures, one would think that Donald Trump is in NO position to be criticizing others and judging his more successful predecessors on how they handled business before him. However, this didn t stop him from trying to throw former president Barack Obama under the bus last night as he tried to distract America from focusing on his Russia scandal and the shortcomings of his administration.On Wednesday night, Trump retweeted two tweets that blamed Obama for the current North Korean crisis, which Trump has recently f*cked up beyond belief by threatening the regime with nuclear attacks. Those tweets were from John Bolton and Fox News   The Five , which of course were anti-Obama and patting Trump on the back for being an  unpredictable  basket case on the North Korea situation. Here are the tweets:Trump seriously cannot stand how loved Obama is by Americans, and tries to tear him down every chance he gets. Obama has a track record and popularity that Trump will never achieve, and he can t stand it. He only knows how to cope by blaming Obama for his own failures.The reason we re currently in crisis is because of Trump and his erratic threats to North Korea. Obama was a measured, thoughtful leader who never would have acted so recklessly. Trump, on the other hand, nixed the idea of negotiations and went straight to threatening nuclear war. Where Obama was an adult who understood complexities, Trump is a child who acts with his emotions and insecurities.If you re disgusted by Trump trashing Obama, you re not alone. Once Trump retweeted those posts, America responded with outrage and made Trump regret it:   Read more:Featured image via Alex Wong and Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",

         " Legal Community SCHOOLS Trump’s Lawyer For Claiming Collusion Is Not A Crime",
         "Donald Trump s attorney Jay Sekulow made a fool of himself on Tuesday morning.During an interview with ABC host George Stephanopoulos, Sekulow actually claimed that collusion is not a crime in an effort to defend Trump after his associate George Papadopoulos plead guilty to lying to FBI agents about meeting with Russians. He was a volunteer with the campaign, he served on one of the committees,  Sekelow said.  He was involved with individuals that purported to be somehow involved with Russia or Russian government   it s not clear from the documents. The end result is the meeting doesn t take place. So what you had is you had all this conversation about collusion. Remember this, collusion in and of itself   there s no crime of collusion. Even Stephanopoulos knew that claim was bullshit. Collusion is cooperation and that s what he was doing with Russians,  Stephanopoulos replied.Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, collusion is just another word for  conspiracy,  which is a crime. A MAJOR crime.Sekulow s claim was immediately debunked by prominent members of the legal community.Harvard University law professor John Coates and University of California, Irvine law professor Rick Hasen schooled Sekulow. It is a federal crime to conspire with anyone, including a foreign government, to  deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,  Coates told Politifact after Fox News host Eric Bolling made the same claim in July.  That would include fixing a fraudulent election, in my view, within the plain meaning of the statute. If others participated in the scheme to do this it could be a conspiracy,  Hasen added.  Whether you want to call that  collusion  or not seems besides the point. In short, Trump s own attorney doesn t understand the law and apparently thinks that the use of the word  collusion  absolves Trump and his campaign team of any crimes. But that s simply not the case and any self-respecting judge would laugh at Sekulow in open court if he tried to use such a defense.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",

         "FBI's Comey meets with top U.S. congressional leaders",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey on Thursday met with senior congressional leaders, including the intelligence committee chiefs, FBI and congressional officials said. The officials declined to discuss the subject of Comey’s meeting with the group of leaders known as the “Gang of Eight”. U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged that the Obama administration wiretapped his election campaign. The Gang of Eight, who have routine access to highly classified materials, include House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and its top Democrat, Adam Schiff. Senate members include Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the top Republican and Democrat on the intelligence committee, Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner. The House intelligence committee on Wednesday asked the Justice Department in a letter for copies of documents which if they exist could shed light on Trump’s allegation. A law enforcement source said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was in discussions with the National Security Division of the Justice Department as to how to respond to public and congressional inquiries about the existence or non-existence of such eavesdropping. If Trump’s campaign or advisers were indeed being wiretapped, the most likely legal path for the Obama administration to do so would be to have the Justice Department ask the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for permission to eavesdrop. Trump accused predecessor Barack Obama on Saturday of wiretapping him during the late stages of the campaign, but offered no evidence for an allegation which an Obama spokesman said was “simply false”. The intelligence committee’s letter, addressed to Dana Boente, the acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General, also asks for copies of any such orders actually issued by the court and any electronic surveillance warrants related to Trump or his associates issued last year by a federal judge or magistrate under a wide-ranging anti-crime law. Reuters saw a copy of the letter, signed by Nunes and Schiff, on Thursday. The letter has not been publicly released. Nunes said on Tuesday he had seen no evidence to support Trump’s wiretapping allegation. Law enforcement sources have said that the FBI is pursuing a wide-ranging counter-intelligence investigation of alleged contacts between Trump associates and Russians, as well as two separate investigations into pre-election email hacking linked to Russia which mainly targeted Democratic political operatives.

         "BERLIN (Reuters) - Activists from the online campaign group Avaaz tore down a cardboard wall near the site of the former Berlin Wall on Friday to urge American expats in Germany to vote against Republican nominee Donald Trump in the U.S. election on Nov. 8. Many identify Trump with his proposal to build a huge border wall between the United States and Mexico to keep migrants out; moreover, the event was staged in front of the Brandenburg Gate, near the place where U.S. president Ronald Reagan publicly urged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987 to “tear down this wall”. Holding red and blue placards saying “Stop Trump” and “Tear Down Trump’s Wall”, dozens of cheering activists toppled the 2.5 meter (8.2 foot) structure, emblazoned with a picture of Trump, with their hands and rubber mallets. Many of the 150 or so onlookers chanted “The wall must come down!” as it was knocked over.  Around 8 million Americans live abroad but only 12 percent of them voted in the 2012 election, Avaaz said in a statement. “Americans abroad are the ‘Swing State’ that nobody knows about, who could, however, decide the vote this year. A large number of them live in Germany,” said Emma Ruby-Sachs, deputy director of Avaaz.

         " Hypocritical Alabama Governor Gets Booted From His Own Church For Affair With Staffer",
         "Alabama Governor Robert Bentley claims to be a  family values conservative Christian,  but because of an affair with a woman who was not his wife he ll have to find a church that supports hypocrisy.The Republican governor has resisted repeated calls for him to resign his office despite a scandalous audio recording of Bentley admitting to having an affair with Rebekah Mason, a staffer who works for him. I love you,  Bentley told Mason in the recording.  I love to talk to you. Baby, let me tell you what we re going to have to start doing, we re going to have to start locking the door. If we are going to do what we did the other day, we are going to have to start locking the door. To spell it out for anyone who doesn t get it, Bentley told Mason they ll have to lock the door because their relationship became physical, which Bentley denies even though that would be the logical reason why they have to start locking the door. So someone doesn t walk in on them and catch them in the act.Having heard the tape, Bentley s wife filed for divorce, which is not exactly a PR dream come true if you re a lawmaker who touts  traditional  marriage and Christian morality as reasons to oppose same-sex marriage. I have always believed in the Biblical definition of marriage as being between one man and one woman,  Bentley said when the Supreme Court handed down the decision to legalize same-sex marriage across the nation last summer. Apparently he meant between one man and one woman and another secret woman in a locked room. I made a mistake,  Bentley said during a press conference on Wednesday.  Two years ago I made a mistake.   I have apologized many times to my family. I have apologized to the family of Mrs. Mason. I would now like to apologize to the people of Alabama. I ask them to forgive me. I ve been told about the possibility of tapes for two years. While he is still waiting for the people of Alabama to forgive him, Bentley s own church isn t much in the forgiving mood.The First Baptist Church of Tuscaloosa, where Bentley was a deacon, has officially expelled the governor and Mason.Senior Pastor Gil McKee told Christian News Network,  while church discipline is a church family matter, both Governor Robert Bentley and Mrs. Rebekah Mason are no longer members of First Baptist Church Tuscaloosa. I continue to pray for each of them. That s right. Bentley s own church can t stomach having him as a member anymore because he not only cheated on his wife while waving Christianity and  family values  in the faces of his constituents, he is lying about it and refusing to take responsibility by stepping down in disgrace.Seriously, Governor. Resign. That s the only right step you can take that will satisfy the people of Alabama and the God you claim to worship. Featured image via YouTube",

         "Spoken like a true gentleman and warrior in America s fight to defeat the Left The recent disclosure of lewd conversations Donald Trump had over a decade ago has caused some disillusionment among GOP stalwarts and conservative voters. In no way do I condone Trump s behavior   in fact I condemn any form of disrespect towards women.We should always honor and respect the dignity of our mothers, sisters and daughters. Even though the incident happened ten years ago, well before Trump entered the political arena, this behavior is unacceptable, especially by someone who aspires to higher office. Trump did the right thing in immediately and unequivocally apologizing.I feel fairly certain that the progressives have had knowledge of this conversation for a long time and dropped it at this point in time in an effort to obscure the release of damaging information about Hillary Clinton and her desire for open borders. I believe that they have more material that they will release periodically up until the election to keep a negative focus on Donald Trump. They do not want to discuss the vital issues that are destroying our nation and the future of our children, because they do not have logical solutions and offer more of the same that has gotten us into this precarious situation.Those of us who do not want to see America fundamentally devolve into something worse must be wise enough to recognize the scheme that is being played out here. We must demand not only that the issues be discussed but also that we make our decisions based on issues and not on personalities or decade old statements and behavior by Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.The political elites and their loyal media are desperate because they are seeing the large enthusiastic crowds for Donald Trump and the meager crowds for Hillary Clinton, and they know that there will be a huge enthusiasm gap on election day.The question is: will the political elites of both parties succeed in continuing their reign of fiscal irresponsibility and military weakness or will the people understand what is going on and will they be wise enough to thwart those efforts?

         "Echoes of Cold War as NATO mulls new North Atlantic command",
         "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO needs to establish a new regional base for protecting the North Atlantic against increased Russian naval strength, a  senior alliance general said on Monday, as allies consider the next step in a military build-up reminiscent of the Cold War. General Petr Pavel, head of NATO s military committee, will help put the case to allied defense ministers this week for a new planning and strategy base to be located in a chosen NATO ally and focused on keeping Atlantic shipping lanes safe from enemy submarines. It would be the first such expansion in two decades after NATO sharply cut back its commands in 2011.  If we look at the growing capabilities of countries like Russia and China, with a global reach, it is quite obvious that maritime lines of communication have to be protected,  Pavel, a Czech army general, told Reuters in an interview.  We observe increased Russian naval activity in the Arctic in the northern Atlantic ... We also assess that for any future crisis, the reinforcement of Europe and free lines of communication will be vital for European security,  Pavel said.    If approved, the new North Atlantic Command would survey a vast area and, in the event of any potential conflict with Russia, have the task of making sea lanes safe for U.S reinforcements to Europe. Strong in symbolism, the decision is unlikely to revive a much larger Cold War-era Atlantic Command that was disbanded in 2002, but it would broaden NATO s new deterrent against Russia.   Despite NATO s cooperation with Moscow in the Balkans after a 1997 pact formalized friendly ties, the alliance sees the Kremlin s incursions in Georgia and eastern Ukraine and its seizure of Crimea as unacceptable breaches of international law. Pavel described Russia as a  potential threat , while the West was alarmed by Moscow s war games in September that massed tens of thousands of troops and may have tested electronic warfare tools on Latvia, NATO officials say. Since Russia s 2014 Crimea annexation, NATO has sought to reassure its Baltic allies by sending troops to the Baltics, Poland and the Black Sea, setting up a network of NATO outposts, holding more exercises and preparing a rapid response force, including air, maritime and special operations components. The United States have also returned tanks and troops to Europe after a long drawdown at the end of the Cold War. Russia condemns the moves as an aggressive strategy on its frontiers that threatens to destabilize eastern Europe. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will join other allied defense ministers on Wednesday and Thursday to decide whether to approve the North Atlantic Command, as well as a logistics command to focus on moving troops more quickly across Europe.  With renewed purpose since Russia s annexation of Crimea, NATO allies are broadly in favor of the two commands. Many are keen to lock in U.S. support given President Donald Trump s early doubts about the alliance he now says he strongly backs. Pavel cautioned that cost is likely to be an issue for NATO governments and said there were no short cuts in deterrence.   I believe we are now out of the realm of doing more with less. We simply have to understand that wherever we want to do more, there will be resource implications,  Pavel said. The alliance is being asked by Trump to do more in Afghanistan, in fighting Islamist militants and to stop migrants from the Middle East and North Africa reaching Europe. Many European NATO nations are still struggling to meet an alliance goal by 2024 to spend two percent of economic output on defense every year.  We can call it modernization, we can call it adaptation. We simply have to adapt to a new reality,  Pavel said.  ",

         "Cuban investigators say U.S. sonic attack allegations 'science fiction'",
         "HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban officials investigating U.S. complaints of attacks that sickened American diplomats in Havana said talk of acoustic strikes was  science fiction  and accused Washington of  slander  while it refused to cooperate fully with Cuba s enquiry. U.S. President Donald Trump said last week he believed Havana was responsible for 24 diplomats being harmed. Washington expelled 15 Cuban diplomats and recalled more than half the U.S. diplomatic personnel from Havana earlier in October. While Cuba denounced the expulsions as  unjustified  and accused the United States of insufficient cooperation, three Interior Ministry officials and a doctor heading the inquiry provided more details in an interview in Havana on Sunday. Cuba had deployed about 2,000 security officials and experts, from criminologists to audiologists and mathematicians, to investigate the incidents after it became aware of them in February, the investigators said. The probe has not ended but so far has failed to uncover any evidence to corroborate allegations of attacks that the United States says have caused hearing loss, dizziness, fatigue and cognitive issues for diplomatic personnel who were based on the Communist-run island.  This is slander by the United States,  said Coronel Ramiro Ramirez, responsible for the security of diplomats in Cuba. Asked to respond to the Cuban officials  assertions, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the United States had reminded Cuba of its obligation to ensure the safety of U.S. diplomatic personnel and was continuing its investigation of the  attacks.  Washington officials have raised the possibility that sonic weapons were used to harm the diplomats, according to U.S. media reports. However, Cuban investigators denied such weapons could even have been used by third parties without affecting the health of others or attracting attention.  It s impossible. We are talking about science fiction,  said Lieutenant Colonel Jose Alazo, an expert in the criminal investigation unit of the Interior Ministry.  From a technical point of view, that argument is unsustainable.  The investigators said the United States had supplied 14 recordings of the sound it says the victims heard during the attacks and recorded, for example, on cellphones. These, however, did not contain anything that could damage human health, they concluded. The noises included the usual suburban sounds such as traffic, footsteps and voices. They were also characterized by a deviation peak of 7 kiloHertz (kHz) in the frequency band of 3 kHz, similar to the song of a cricket. An audible sound would need to be very loud - above 80 decibels or akin to a plane s engine   to have a health impact, they said. Yet only the victims heard the noise, not their families living in the same houses, or their neighbors.   We interviewed more than 300 people in the neighborhood, we also evaluated more than 30 medically, and no one heard these things,  Alazo said. Even if the U.S. diplomats  reports of loud sounds were misleading and the source of the attacks was infra- or ultrasonic and therefore inaudible to human ears, it would be hard to explain how it could go undetected, the Cuban investigators said.  You would need a source that could be seen from a satellite, it would be enormous,  said Dr Manuel Villar, an ear, nose and throat specialist. Finally, only two or three of the alleged victims had hearing problems, according to the U.S. information provided, whereas any kind of sonic attack would cause them in everyone, Villar said.  ANTI-CUBAN MAFIA  The United States has not formally accused Cuba of carrying out attacks, but Trump s comments further damaged relations between the old Cold War foes, which have rapidly deteriorated since he took office. Canada has said several Canadians had reported similar symptoms to the U.S. diplomats but it has not taken any action against Cuba and has said Cuba had been very cooperative with the investigation. [L2N1LB25E]  There is an anti-Cuban mafia in Miami and we are victims of their dirty work that involve certain people very close to the governing circles of the United States,  Ramirez said. Anti-Castro Cuban-Americans such as Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida have guided Trump s policy on Cuba, including a partial rollback of the historic detente forged by Trump s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Washington insists its drawdown at its embassy was motivated by concern for the health of its diplomats.  The safety and wellbeing of American citizens is our top priority,  said Nauert. Investigators said U.S. actions did not add up with their accusations. More than 200 friends and relatives of U.S. diplomats based in Havana had asked for visas to visit them between February and July, despite the alleged attacks. The fact that the information the United States provided was late was a major obstacle to resolving the mystery, said the investigators, who declined to comment on the state of cooperation with Canada. So far, Washington had only officially reported 14 cases of alleged attacks to Cuba, compared with the 24 it had announced to the media, they said.  It will be impossible to resolve this investigation without more cooperation,  Ramirez said. ",

         "ESTCOURT, South Africa (Reuters) - Police fired rubber bullets and stun grenades to break up crowds hurling insults at a group of men accused of cannibalism in a South African farming town. More than 500 people gathered outside the magistrates court in eastern Kwa-Zulu Natal province on Thursday as the men sat inside, hiding their faces with their hooded tops and their hands. Authorities originally charged seven men after police said one of them had walked into a police station in August with a human leg and a hand. Police spokeswoman Col. Thembeka Mbele told Reuters on Thursday he had confessed that he was tired of eating human flesh. The court acquitted three of the men on Thursday on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder, saying there was a lack of evidence. The other four were held in custody and the case adjourned until Oct. 27.  We have not charged them with cannibalism, as no such charge exists as far as I know,  Mbele said.  No one has seen them eating any of the human parts they had in their possession but we are still investigating,  she added. Officers were also investigating the suspects for the offence of possessing human remains, Mbele said.  Police blocked streets outside the court in the town of Estcourt, about 160 km (100 miles) north of Durban, Kwa-Zulu Natal s biggest city.  They fired the teargas and grenades to keep the crowds at bay as security officers drove all seven men back to jail - the three acquitted man were released later.  Members of the crowd shouted back at officers.  Where were you when they were eating people?  said one.  Some protesters told local media they feared missing loved ones may have been eaten. Others have linked the deaths with witchcraft, referring to traditional medicines that can be made from a range of ingredients including animal or human body parts. ",
